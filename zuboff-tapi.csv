0|0|4|"[S]urveillance capitalism departs from the history of market capitalism in three startling ways. First, it insists on the privilege of unfettered freedom *and* knowledge. Second, it abandons long-standing organic reciprocities with people. Third, the specter of life in the hive betrays a collectivist societal vision sustained by radical indifference and its material expression in Big Other. In this chapter we explore each of these departures from historical norms and then face the question that they raise: is surveillance capitalism merely ""capitalism""?"|Chap 0, Para 4|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
1|0|5|"Surveillance capitalists are no different from other capitalists in demanding freedom from any sort of constraint. They insist upon the ""freedom to"" launch every novel practice while aggressively asserting the necessity of their ""freedom from"" law and regulation. This classic pattern reflects two bedrock assumptions about capitalism made by its own theorists: The first is that markets are intrinsically *unknowable.* The second is that the ignorance produced by this lack of knowledge requires wide-ranging *freedom* of action for market actors."|Chap 0, Para 5|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
2|0|6|"[]The notion that ignorance and freedom are essential characteristics of capitalism is rooted in the conditions of life before the advent of modern systems of communication and transportation, let alone global digital networks, the internet, or the ubiquitous computational, sensate, actuating architectures of Big Other. Until the last few moments of the human story, life was necessarily local, and the ""whole"" was necessarily invisible to the ""part."""|Chap 0, Para 6|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
3|0|7|"Adam Smith's famous metaphor of the ""invisible hand"" drew on these enduring realities of human life. Each individual, Smith reasoned, employs his capital locally in pursuit of immediate comforts and necessities. Each one attends to ""his own security... his own gain... led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."" That end is the efficient employ of capital in the broader market: the wealth of nations. The individual actions that produce efficient markets add up to a staggeringly complex pattern, a mystery that no one person or entity could hope to know or understand, let alone to direct: ""The statesman, who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would... assume an authority which could safely be trusted, not only to no single person, but to no council or senate whatever...."""|Chap 0, Para 7|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
4|0|8|"The neoliberal economist Friedrich Hayek, whose work we discussed briefly in [Chapter 2](chapter002.xhtml) as the foundation for the market-privileging economic policies of the past half century, drew the most basic tenets of his arguments from Smith's assumptions about the whole and the part. ""Adam Smith,"" Hayek wrote, ""was the first to perceive that we have stumbled upon methods of ordering human economic cooperation that exceed the limits of our knowledge and perception. His 'invisible hand' had perhaps better have been described as an invisible or unsurveyable pattern."""|Chap 0, Para 8|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
5|0|9|"As with Planck, Meyer, and Skinner, both Hayek and Smith unequivocally link freedom and ignorance. In Hayek's framing, the mystery of the market is that a great many people can behave effectively while remaining ignorant of the whole. Individuals not only *can* choose freely, but they *must* freely choose their own pursuits because there is no alternative, no source of total knowledge or conscious control to guide them. ""Human design"" is impossible, Hayek says, because the relevant information flows are ""beyond the span of the control of any one mind."" The market dynamic makes it possible []for people to operate in ignorance without ""anyone having to tell them what to do."""|Chap 0, Para 9|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
6|0|10|"Hayek chose the market over democracy, arguing that the market system enabled not only the division of labor but also ""the coordinated utilization of resources based on *equally divided knowledge.*"" This system, he argued, is the only one compatible with freedom. Perhaps some other kind of civilization might have been devised, he reckoned, ""like the 'state' of the termite ants,"" but it would not be compatible with human freedom."|Chap 0, Para 10|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
7|0|11|Something is awry. It is true that many capitalists, including surveillance capitalists, vigorously employ these centuries-old justifications for their freedom when they reject regulatory, legislative, judicial, societal, or any other form of public interference in their methods of operation. However, Big Other and the steady application of instrumentarian power challenge the classic quid pro quo of freedom for ignorance.|Chap 0, Para 11|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
8|0|12|"When it comes to surveillance capitalist operations, the ""market"" is no longer invisible, certainly not in the way that Smith or Hayek imagined. The competitive struggle among surveillance capitalists produces the compulsion toward totality. Total information tends toward certainty and the promise of guaranteed outcomes. These operations mean that the supply and demand of behavioral futures markets are rendered in infinite detail. Surveillance capitalism thus replaces mystery with certainty as it substitutes rendition, behavioral modification, and prediction for the old ""unsurveyable pattern."" This is a fundamental reversal of the classic ideal of the ""market"" as intrinsically unknowable."|Chap 0, Para 12|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
9|0|13|"Recall Mark Zuckerberg's boast that Facebook would know every book, film, and song a person had ever consumed and that its predictive models would tell you what bar to go to when you arrive in a strange city, where the bartender would have your favorite drink waiting. As the head of Facebook's data science team once reflected, ""This is the first time the world has seen this scale and quality of data about human communication.... For the first time, we have a microscope that... lets us examine social behavior at a very fine level that we've never been able to see before...."" A top Facebook engineer put it succinctly: ""We are trying to map out the graph of everything in the world and how it relates to each other."""|Chap 0, Para 13|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
10|0|14|"[]The same objectives are echoed in the other leading surveillance capitalist firms. As Google's Eric Schmidt observed in 2010, ""You give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our searches. We don't need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about.""

11|0|15|Surveillance capitalism is not the old capitalism, and its leaders are not Smith's or even Hayek's capitalists. Under this regime, freedom and ignorance are no longer twin born, no longer two sides of the same coin called mystery. Surveillance capitalism is instead defined by an unprecedented convergence of freedom *and* knowledge. The degree of that convergence corresponds exactly to the scope of instrumentarian power. This unimpeded accumulation of power effectively hijacks the division of learning in society, instituting the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion upon which surveillance revenues depend. Surveillance capitalists claim the freedom to order knowledge, and then they leverage that knowledge advantage in order to protect and expand their freedom.|Chap 0, Para 15|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
12|0|16|Although there is nothing unusual about the prospect of capitalist enterprises seeking every kind of knowledge advantage in a competitive marketplace, the surveillance capitalist capabilities that translate ignorance into knowledge are unprecedented because they rely on the one resource that distinguishes the surveillance capitalists from traditional utopianists: the financial and intellectual capital that permits the actual transformation of the world, materialized in the continuously expanding architectures of Big Other. More astonishing still is that surveillance capital derives from the dispossession of human experience, operationalized in its unilateral and pervasive programs of rendition: *our lives are scraped and sold to fund their freedom and our subjugation, their knowledge and our ignorance about what they know.*|Chap 0, Para 16|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
13|0|17|This new condition unravels the neoliberal justification for the evisceration of the double movement and the triumph of raw capitalism: its free markets, free-market actors, and self-regulating enterprises. It suggests that surveillance capitalists mastered the rhetoric and political genius of the []neoliberal ideological defense while pursuing a novel logic of accumulation that belies the most fundamental postulates of the capitalist worldview. It's not just that the cards have been reshuffled; the rules of the game have been transformed into something that is both unprecedented and unimaginable outside the digital milieu and the vast resources of wealth and scientific prowess that the new applied utopianists bring to the table.|Chap 0, Para 17|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
14|0|18|We have carefully examined surveillance capitalism's novel foundational mechanisms, economic imperatives, gathering power, and societal objectives. One conclusion of our investigations is that surveillance capitalism's command and control of the division of learning in society are the signature feature that breaks with the old justifications of the invisible hand and its entitlements. The combination of knowledge and freedom works to accelerate the asymmetry of power between surveillance capitalists and the societies in which they operate. This cycle will be broken only when we acknowledge as citizens, as societies, and indeed as a civilization that s*urveillance capitalists know too much to qualify for freedom.*|Chap 0, Para 18|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
15|0|19|"In another decisive break with capitalism's past, surveillance capitalists abandon the organic reciprocities with people that have long been a mark of capitalism's endurance and adaptability. Symbolized in the twentieth century by Ford's five-dollar day, these reciprocities hearken back to Adam Smith's original insights into the productive social relations of capitalism, in which firms rely on people as employees and customers. Smith argued that price increases had to be balanced with wage increases ""so that the labourer may still be able to purchase that quantity of those necessary articles which the state of the demand for labour... requires that he should have."" The shareholder-value movement and globalization went a long way toward destroying this centuries-old social contract between capitalism and its communities, substituting formal indifference for reciprocity. Surveillance capitalism goes further. It not only jettisons Smith, but it also formally rescinds any remaining reciprocities with its societies."|Chap 0, Para 19|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
16|0|20|"First, surveillance capitalists no longer rely on people as consumers. Instead, the axis of supply and demand orients the surveillance capitalist firm []to businesses intent on anticipating the behavior of populations, groups, and individuals. The result, as we have seen, is that ""users"" are sources of raw material for a digital-age production process aimed at a new business customer. Where individual consumers continue to exist in surveillance capitalist operations---purchasing Roomba vacuum cleaners, dolls that spy, smart vodka bottles, or behavior-based insurance policies, just to name a few examples---social relations are no longer founded on mutual exchange. In these and many other instances, products and services are merely hosts for surveillance capitalism's parasitic operations."|Chap 0, Para 20|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
17|0|21|"Second, by historical standards the large surveillance capitalists employ relatively few people compared to their unprecedented computational resources. This pattern, in which a small, highly educated workforce leverages the power of a massive capital-intensive infrastructure, is called ""hyperscale."" The historical discontinuity of the hyperscale business operation becomes apparent by comparing seven decades of GM employment levels and market capitalization to recent post-IPO data from Google and Facebook. (I have confined the comparison here to Google and Facebook because both were pure surveillance capitalist firms even before their public offerings.)"|Chap 0, Para 21|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
18|0|22|From the time they went public to 2016, Google and Facebook steadily climbed to the heights of market capitalization, with Google reaching \$532 billion by the end of 2016 and Facebook reaching \$332 billion, without Google ever employing more than 75,000 people or Facebook more than 18,000. General Motors took four decades to reach its highest market capitalization of \$225.15 billion in 1965, when it employed 735,000 women and men. Most startling is that GM employed more people during the height of the Great Depression than either Google or Facebook employs at their heights of market capitalization.|Chap 0, Para 22|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
19|0|23|"The GM pattern is the iconic story of the United States in the twentieth century, before globalization, neoliberalism, the shareholder-value movement, and plutocracy unraveled the public corporation and the institutions of the double movement. Those institutions rationalized GM's employment policies with fair labor practices, unionization, and collective bargaining, emblematic of stable reciprocities during the pre-globalization decades of the twentieth century. In the 1950s, for example, 80 percent of adults said that []""big business"" was a good thing for the country, 66 percent believed that business required little or no change, and 60 percent agreed that ""the profits of large companies help make things better for everyone who buys their products or services."""|Chap 0, Para 23|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
20|0|24|Although some critics blamed these reciprocities for GM's failure to adapt to global competition in the late 1980s, leading eventually to its bankruptcy in 2009, analyses have shown that chronic managerial complacency and doomed financial strategies bore the greatest share of responsibility for the firm's legendary decline, a conclusion that is fortified by the successes of the German automobile industry in the twenty-first century, where strong labor institutions formally share decision making authority.|Chap 0, Para 24|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
21|0|25|Hyperscale firms have become emblematic of modern digital capitalism, and as capitalist inventions they present significant social and economic challenges, including their impact on employment and wages, industry concentration, and monopoly. In 2017, 24 hyperscale firms operated 320 data centers with anywhere between thousands and millions of servers (Google and Facebook were among the largest).|Chap 0, Para 25|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
22|0|26|Not all hyperscale firms are surveillance capitalists, however, and our focus here is restricted to the convergence of these two domains. The surveillance capitalists that operate at hyperscale or outsource to hyperscale operations dramatically diminish any reliance on their societies as sources of employees, and the few for whom they do compete, as we have seen, are drawn from the most-rarefied strata of data science.|Chap 0, Para 26|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
23|0|27|The absence of organic reciprocities with people as either sources of consumers or employees is a matter of exceptional importance in light of the historical relationship between market capitalism and democracy. In fact, the origins of democracy in both America and Britain have been traced to these very reciprocities. In America the violation of consumer reciprocities awakened an unstoppable march toward liberty as economic power translated into political power. A half century later in Britain, a grudging, practical, self-interested respect for the necessary interdependence of capital and labor translated into new patterns of political power, expressed in the gradual expansion of the franchise and the nonviolent shift to more-inclusive democratic institutions. Even a brief glance at these world-altering histories can []help us grasp the degree to which surveillance capitalism diverges from capitalism's past.|Chap 0, Para 27|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
24|0|28|"The American Revolution is the outstanding example of how the reciprocities of consumption contributed to the rise of democracy. Historian T. H. Breen argues in his pathbreaking study *The Marketplace of Revolution* that it was the violation of these reciprocities that set the Revolution into motion, uniting disparate provincial strangers into a radical new patriotic force. Breen explains that American colonists had come to depend upon the ""empire of goods"" imported from England and that this dependency instilled the sense of a reciprocal social contract: ""For ordinary people, the palpable experience of participating in an expanding Anglo-American consumer market"" intensified their sense of a ""genuine partnership"" with England. Eventually, the British Parliament famously misjudged the rights and obligations of this partnership, imposing a series of taxes that turned imported goods such as cloth and tea into ""symbols of imperial oppression."" Breen describes the originality of a political movement born in the shared experience of consumption, the outrage at the violation of essential producer-consumer interdependencies, and the determination to make ""goods speak to power."""|Chap 0, Para 28|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
25|0|29|"The translation of consumer expectations into democratic revolution occurred in three waves, beginning in 1765, when the Stamp Act triggered popular protests, riots, and organized resistance finally expressed in the ""nonimportation movement"" (today we would call it a consumer boycott). As Breen tells it, the details of the Stamp Act were less important than the colonists' realization that England did not perceive them as political or economic equals bound in mutually beneficial reciprocities: ""By compromising the Americans' ability to purchase the goods they desired, Parliament had revealed an intention to treat the colonists like second-class subjects,"" levying a heavy price ""on the pursuit of material happiness."" The Stamp Act was experienced as a violation of the colonists' rights not only as subjects of the empire but also as consumers of the empire: it was the first translation of consumers' economic power into political power, a ""radically new form of politics"" in which the most ordinary members of colonial society experienced ""an exhilarating surge of empowerment."" Parliament withdrew the Stamp Act before the nonimportation movement could effectively spread across the []colonies, and it appeared that the principle of ""no taxation without representation"" had prevailed."|Chap 0, Para 29|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
26|0|30|When the Townshend Acts were passed just two years later, in 1767, this time imposing taxes on a range of imported goods, a new wave of outrage mobilized people in every colony. Detailed nonimportation agreements turned consumer sacrifice into the front line of political resistance. The shared experience of violated expectations cut across regional, religious, and cultural differences, providing a new basis for social solidarity. By 1770, the Townshend Acts were also repealed, and once again it seemed that a full-blown rebellion would be avoided.|Chap 0, Para 30|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
27|0|31|"The 1773 Tea Act plunged the colonies into a new phase of resistance that shifted the political focus from nonimportation, which depended upon merchants holding the line, to *nonconsumption,* which demanded the participation of all individuals in the unique solidarity of their shared status as ""customers."" It was in this context that Samuel Adams proclaimed that the cause of liberty ""depended on the ability of the American people to free themselves from 'the Baubles of Britain.'"""|Chap 0, Para 31|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
28|0|32|"British goods had so thoroughly come to symbolize dependency and oppression that when the tiny impoverished community of Harvard, Massachusetts, gathered to discuss the merchant vessels arriving in Boston Harbor loaded with chests of tea, they deemed it ""a matter of as interesting and important a nature when viewed in all its Consequences not only to this Town and Province, but to America in general, and that for ages and generations to come, as ever came under the deliberation of this Town."""|Chap 0, Para 32|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
29|0|33|"A year later, in 1774, the First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia and produced a ""grand scheme"" to abolish trade with England. ""It brought to fruition a brilliantly original strategy of consumer resistance to political oppression,"" Breen writes, ""one that had invited Americans to think of themselves as Americans even before they entertained a thought of independence."""|Chap 0, Para 33|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
30|0|34|"In early-nineteenth-century Britain, as Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson have shown, the rise of democracy was inextricably bound to industrial capitalism's dependency on the ""masses"" and their contribution to the prosperity necessitated by the new organization of production. The rise []of volume production and its wage-earning labor force established British workers' economic power and led to a growing appreciation of their political legitimacy and power. This produced a new sense of interdependence between ordinary people and elites."|Chap 0, Para 34|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
31|0|35|"Acemoglu and Robinson conclude that the ""dynamic positive feedback"" between ""inclusive economic institutions"" (i.e., industrial firms defined by employment reciprocities) and political institutions was critical to Britain's substantial and nonviolent democratic reforms. Inclusive economic institutions, they argue, ""level the playing field,"" especially when it comes to the fight for power, making it more difficult for elites to ""crush the masses"" rather than accede to their demands. Reciprocities in employment produced and sustained reciprocities in politics: ""Clamping down on popular demands and undertaking a coup against inclusive political institutions would... destroy... \[economic\] gains, and the elites opposing greater democratization and greater inclusiveness might find themselves among those losing their fortunes from this destruction."" In sharp contrast to the pragmatic concessions of Britain's early industrial capitalists, surveillance capitalists' extreme structural independence from people breeds exclusion rather than inclusion and lays the foundation for the unique approach that we have called ""radical indifference."""|Chap 0, Para 35|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
32|0|36|The accumulation of freedom *and* knowledge combines with the lack of organic reciprocities with people to shape a third unusual feature of surveillance capitalism: a collectivist orientation that diverges from the long-standing values of market capitalism and market democracy, while also sharply departing from surveillance capitalism's origins in the neoliberal worldview. For the sake of its own commercial success, surveillance capitalism aims us toward the hive collective. This privatized instrumentarian social order is a new form of collectivism in which it is the market, not the state, which concentrates both knowledge and freedom within its domain.|Chap 0, Para 36|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
33|0|37|"This collectivist orientation is an unexpected development in light of surveillance capitalism's origins in a neoliberal creed conceived sixty years ago []as a reaction to the collectivist totalitarian nightmares of the mid-twentieth century. Later, with the demise of the fascist and socialist threats, neoliberal ideology cunningly succeeded in redefining the modern democratic state as a fresh source of collectivism to be resisted by any and all means. Indeed, the evisceration of the double movement has been prosecuted in the name of defeating the supposed collectivist hazards of ""too much democracy."" Now the hive emulates the ""termite state,"" which even the democracy-despising Hayek derided as incompatible with human freedom."|Chap 0, Para 37|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
34|0|38|"The convergence of freedom and knowledge transforms surveillance capitalists into society's self-appointed masters. From their high perch in the division of learning, a privileged priesthood of ""tuners"" rules the connected hive, cultivating it as a source of continuous raw-material supply. Just as early-twentieth-century managers were once taught the ""administrative point of view"" as the mode of knowledge required for the hierarchical complexities of the new large-scale corporation, today's high priests practice the applied arts of radical indifference, a fundamentally asocial mode of knowledge. With the application of radical indifference, content is judged by its volume, range, and depth of surplus as measured by the ""anonymous"" equivalence of clicks, likes, and dwell times, despite the obvious fact that its profoundly dissimilar meanings originate in distinct human situations."|Chap 0, Para 38|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
35|0|39|"Radical indifference is a response to economic imperatives, and only occasionally do we catch an unobstructed view of its strict application as a managerial discipline. One such occasion was a 2016 internal Facebook memo acquired by *BuzzFeed* in 2018. Written by one of the company's long-standing and most influential executives, Andrew Bosworth, it provided a window into radical indifference as an applied discipline. ""We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly,"" Bosworth began. He went on to explain how equivalence wins out over equality in the worldview of ""an organism among organisms"" that is essential to the march toward totality and thus the growth of surveillance revenues:"|Chap 0, Para 39|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
36|0|40|:::  We connect people. That can be good if they make it positive. Maybe someone finds love. Maybe it even saves the life of someone on the brink of suicide. So we connect more people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. []Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that... anything that allows us to connect more people more often is de facto good. It is perhaps the only area where the metrics do tell the true story as far as we are concerned.... That's why all the work we do in growth is justified. All the questionable contact importing practices. All the subtle language that helps people stay searchable by friends. All of the work we do to bring more communication in.... The best products don't win. The ones everyone uses win... make no mistake, growth tactics are how we got here. :::|Chap 0, Para 40|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
37|0|41|"As Bosworth makes clear, from the viewpoint of radical indifference the positives and negatives must be viewed as equivalent, despite their distinct moral meanings and human consequences. From this perspective the only rational objective is the pursuit of products that snare ""everyone,"" not ""the best products."""|Chap 0, Para 41|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
38|0|42|"A significant result of the systematic application of radical indifference is that the public-facing ""first text"" is vulnerable to corruption with content that would normally be perceived as repugnant: lies, systematic disinformation, fraud, violence, hate speech, and so on. As long as content contributes to ""growth tactics,"" Facebook ""wins."" This vulnerability can be an explosive problem on the demand side, the user side, but it breaks through the fortifications of radical indifference only when it threatens to interrupt the flow of surplus into the second ""shadow"" text: the one that is for them but not for us. The norm is that information corruption is not catalogued as problematic unless it poses an existential threat to supply operations---Bosworth's imperative of connection---either because it might trigger user disengagement or because it might attract regulatory scrutiny. This means that any efforts toward ""content moderation"" are best understood as defensive measures, not as acts of public responsibility."|Chap 0, Para 42|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE
39|0|43|"So far, the greatest challenge to radical indifference has come from Facebook and Google's overreaching ambitions to supplant professional journalism on the internet. Both corporations inserted themselves between publishers and their populations, subjecting journalistic ""content"" to the []same categories of equivalence that dominate surveillance capitalism's other landscapes. In a formal sense, professional journalism is the precise opposite of radical indifference. The journalist's job is to produce news and analysis that separate truth from falsehood. This rejection of equivalence defines journalism's raison d'être as well as its organic reciprocities with its readers. Under surveillance capitalism, though, these reciprocities are erased. A consequential example was Facebook's decision to standardize the presentation of its News Feed content so that ""all news stories looked roughly the same as each other... whether they were investigations in *The Washington Post,* gossip in the *New York Post,* or flat-out lies in the *Denver Guardian,* an entirely bogus newspaper.""

In 2007 a prominent financial analyst worried that the subprime mortgage bust would harm Google's lucrative ad business. It seems a strange observation until you learn that in the years prior to the Great Recession, Google eagerly welcomed shady subprime lenders into its behavioral futures markets, anxious to net the lion's share of the \$200 million in monthly revenue that mortgage lenders were spending on online advertising. A 2011 Consumer Watchdog report on Google's advertising []practices leading up to and during the Great Recession concluded that ""Google has been a prominent beneficiary of the national home loan and foreclosure crisis... by accepting deceptive advertising from fraudulent operators who falsely promise unwary consumers that they can solve their mortgage and credit problems.""

Sometimes referred to as ""janitors,"" they review queues of content that users have flagged as problematic. Although some general rules apply across the board, such as eliminating pornography and images of child abuse, a detailed rulebook aims to reject as little content as possible in the context of a local assessment of the minimum threshold of user tolerance. The larger point of the exercise is to find the point of equilibrium between the ability to pull users and their surplus into the site and the risk of repelling them.

It was the individual's experience of insignificance, expendability, political isolation, and loneliness that stoked the fires of totalitarian terror. Such ideologies, Arendt observed, appear as ""a last support in a world where nobody is reliable and nothing can be relied upon."" Years later, in his moving 1966 essay ""Education after Auschwitz,"" social theorist Theodor Adorno attributed the success of German fascism to the ways in which the quest for effective life had become an overwhelming burden for too many people: ""One must accept that fascism and the terror it caused are connected with the fact that the old established authorities... decayed and were toppled, while the people psychologically were not yet ready for self-determination.

Despite the democratic promise of its rhetoric and capabilities, it contributed to a new Gilded Age of extreme wealth inequality, as well as to once-unimaginable new forms of []economic exclusivity and new sources of social inequality that separate the tuners from the tuned. Among the many insults to democracy and democratic institutions imposed by this *coup des gens,* I count the unauthorized expropriation of human experience; the hijack of the division of learning in society; the structural independence from people; the stealthy imposition of the hive collective; the rise of instrumentarian power and the radical indifference that sustains its extractive logic; the construction, ownership, and operation of the means of behavior modification that is Big Other; the abrogation of the elemental right to the future tense and the elemental right to sanctuary; the degradation of the self-determining individual as the fulcrum of democratic life; and the insistence on psychic numbing as the answer to its illegitimate quid pro quo. We can now see that surveillance capitalism takes an even more expansive turn toward domination than its neoliberal source code would predict, claiming its right to freedom *and* knowledge, while setting its sights on a collectivist vision that claims the totality of society.

The professor was an optimist and a tireless educator who believed that legislative and judicial action invariably reflect the public opinion of twenty to thirty years earlier. It was an insight that he and Hayek---the two have been described as ""soul mates and adversaries""---had crafted and transformed into systematic strategies and tactics. As Hayek told Robert Bork in a 1978 interview, ""I'm operating on public opinion. I don't even believe that before public opinion has changed, a change in the law will do any good... the primary thing is to change opinion....""

86|0|90|[]Burnham's cowardice is a cautionary tale. We are living in a moment when surveillance capitalism and its instrumentarian power appear to be invincible. Orwell's courage demands that we refuse to cede the future to illegitimate power. He asks us to break the spell of enthrallment, helplessness, resignation, and numbing. We answer his call when we bend ourselves toward friction, rejecting the smooth flows of coercive confluence. Orwell's courage sets us against the relentless tides of dispossession that demean all human experience. Friction, courage, and bearings are the resources we require to begin the shared work of synthetic declarations that claim the digital future as a human place, demand that digital capitalism operate as an inclusive force bound to the people it must serve, and defend the division of learning in society as a source of genuine democratic renewal.|Chap 0, Para 90|00 HOME OR EXILE IN THE DIGITAL FUTURE

He did so in a way that suggests both its utter lack of precedent and the danger of confounding it with what has gone before: ""hundreds of computers in every room, all capable of sensing people near them and linked by high-speed networks have the potential to make totalitarianism up to now seem like sheerest anarchy."" In fact, all those computers are not the means to a digital hyper-totalitarianism. They are, as I think Weiser sensed, the foundation of an unprecedented power that can reshape society in unprecedented ways.

Today the real thing is inspirational fodder for surveillance capitalist rhetoric as leaders promote the tools and visions that will bring the old professor's ideas to life... to *our* *lives*. The processes of normalization and habituation have begun. We []have already seen that surveillance capitalism's pursuit of certainty---the mandate of the prediction imperative---requires a continuous approximation to total information as the ideal condition for machine intelligence. On the trail of totality, surveillance capitalists enlarged their scope from the virtual to the real world. The reality business renders all people, things, and processes as computational objects in an endless queue of equivalence without equality. Now, as the reality business intensifies, the pursuit of totality necessarily leads to the annexation of ""society,"" ""social relations,"" and key societal processes as a fresh terrain for rendition, calculation, modification, and prediction."|Chap 1, Para 7|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
93|1|8|Big Other's ubiquity is revered as inevitable, but that is not the endgame. The aim in this new phase is the comprehensive visibility, coordination, confluence, control, and harmonization of social processes in the pursuit of scale, scope, and action. Although instrumentarianism and totalitarianism are distinct species, they each yearn toward totality, though in profoundly different ways. Totalitarianism seeks totality as a political condition and relies on violence to clear its path. Instrumentarianism seeks totality as a condition of market dominance, and it relies on its control over the division of learning in society, enabled and enforced by Big Other, to clear its path. The result is the application of instrumentarian power to societal optimization for the sake of market objectives: a utopia of certainty.|Chap 1, Para 8|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
94|1|9|Although they resonate in many respects with the instrumentarian social vision of China's political elite, surveillance capitalists have distinct objectives. In their view, instrumentarian society is a market opportunity. Any norms and values they impose are designed to further the certain fulfillment of market goals. Like human experience, society is subordinated to the market dynamic and reborn as objectified computational behavioral metrics available to surveillance capitalism's economies of scale, scope, and action in the pursuit of the most-lucrative supplies of behavioral surplus. In order to achieve these aims, surveillance capitalists have conjured a chilling vision. They aim to fashion a new society that emulates machine learning in much the same way that industrial society was patterned on the disciplines and methods of factory production. In their vision, instrumentarian power replaces social trust, Big Other substitutes certainty for social relations, and society as we know it shades into obsolescence.|Chap 1, Para 9|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM

All power yearns toward totality, and only authority stands in the way: democratic institutions; laws; regulations; rights and obligations; private governance rules and contracts; the normal market constraints exercised by consumers, competitors, and employees; civil society; the political authority of the people; and the moral authority of individual human beings who have their bearings.|Chap 1, Para 25|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM

The notion that Big Other will solve all of humanity's problems while empowering each individual is usually dismissed as mere ""techno utopianism,"" but it would be a mistake for us to ignore this rhetoric without examining its purpose. Such discourse is no mere hogwash. It is the minesweeper that precedes the foot soldiers and the canny diplomat sent ahead to disarm the enemy and smooth []the way for a quiet surrender.

113|1|36|"The ""societal goal"" articulated by the leading surveillance capitalists fits snugly into the notion of limitless technological progress that dominated utopian thought from the late eighteenth century through the late nineteenth century, culminating with Marx. Indeed, surveillance capitalists such as Nadella, Page, and Zuckerberg conform to five of the six elements with which the great scholars of utopian thought, Frank and Fritzie Manuel, define the classic profile of the most ambitious modern utopianists: (1) a tendency toward highly focused tunnel vision that simplifies the utopian challenge, (2) an earlier and more trenchant grasp of a ""new state of being"" than other contemporaries, (3) the obsessive pursuit and defense of an *idée fixe,* (4) an unshakable belief in the inevitability of one's ideas coming to fruition, and (5) the drive for total reformation at the level of the species and the entire world system."|Chap 1, Para 36|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
114|1|37|"The Manuels observe a sixth characteristic of the future-oriented modern visionary, and this is where the men and the corporations examined here represent powerful exceptions to the rule: ""Often a utopian foresees the later evolution and consequences of technological development already present in an embryonic state; he may have antennae sensitive to the future. *His gadgets, however, rarely go beyond the mechanical potentialities of his age. Try as he may to invent something wholly new, he cannot make a world out of nothing.*"" In our time, however, surveillance capitalists can and do make such a world---a genuinely historic deviation from the norm."|Chap 1, Para 37|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
115|1|38|Individually and collectively, the knowledge, power, and wealth that surveillance capitalists command would be the envy of any ancient potentate, just as they are now coveted by the modern state. With 2017 balance sheets reporting \$126 billion in cash and securities for Microsoft, \$92 billion for Google, and about \$30 billion for Facebook, and the financial markets endorsing their ever-expanding instrumentarian regimes with more than \$1.6 trillion in market capitalization in mid-2017, these are the rare utopianists who can oversee the translation of their imaginations into fact without soldiers to pave the way in blood.|Chap 1, Para 38|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
116|1|39|"[]In this respect, the surveillance capitalist leaders are sui generis utopianists. Marx grasped the world with his thickly articulated theory, but with only the power of his ideas, he could not implement his vision. Long after the publication of Marx's theories, men such as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao applied them to real life. Indeed, the Manuels describe Lenin as a specialist in ""applied utopistics."" In contrast, the surveillance capitalists seize the world in practice. Their theories are thin---at least this is true of the thinking that they share with the public. The opposite is true of their power, which is monumental and largely unimpeded."|Chap 1, Para 39|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
117|1|40|When it comes to theory and practice, the usual sequence is that theory is available to inspect, interrogate, and debate before action is initiated. This allows observers an opportunity to judge a theory's worthiness for application, to consider unanticipated consequences of application, and to evaluate an application's fidelity to the theory in which it originates. The unavoidable gap between theory and practice creates a space for critical inquiry. For example, we can question whether a law or governmental practice is consistent with a nation's constitution, charter of rights, and governing principles because we can inspect, interpret, and debate those documents. If the gap is too great, citizens act to close the gap by challenging the law or practice.|Chap 1, Para 40|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
118|1|41|The surveillance capitalists reverse the normal sequence of theory and practice. Their practices move ahead at high velocity in the absence of an explicit and contestable theory. They specialize in displays of instrumentarianism's unique brand of shock and awe, leaving onlookers dazed, uncertain, and helpless. The absence of a clear articulation of their theory leaves the rest of us to ponder its practical effects: the vehicular monitoring system that shuts down your engine; the destination that appears with the route; the suggested purchase that flashes on your phone the moment your endorphins peak; Big Other's continuous tracking of your location, behavior, and mood; and its cheerful herding of city dwellers toward surveillance capitalism's customers.|Chap 1, Para 41|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
119|1|42|However meager and secretive the surveillance capitalists' theories might be, the instrumentarian power they wield can make their dreams come true, or at least inflict a whirlwind of consequences as they try.

Our hope is that this model provides examples of how collective decision-making may work in other aspects of the global community.""

123|1|46|"The reveal begins with Nadella's account of a Microsoft collaboration with a 150-year-old Swedish manufacturer of high-precision metal-cutting equipment that has reinvented itself for the twenty-first century. The project is a state-of-the-art illustration of what Nadella describes as the ""fundamental []change in the paradigm of the apps that we are building, a change in the worldview that we have... from... a mobile-first, cloud-first world to a new world that is going to be made up of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge."" Artificial intelligence, he says, ""learns from information and interacts with the physical world,"" thus citing the capabilities required for economies of action."|Chap 1, Para 46|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
124|1|47|"Nadella first describes the machines linked by telemetry in the new factory setting as they continuously stream data to the ""IoT hub"" in the ""cloud,"" where Microsoft's analyses search out anomalies that could put the machines at risk. Each anomaly is traced back through the data stream to its cause, and machine intelligence in the hub learns to identify the causal patterns so that it can preemptively shut down a threatened piece of equipment in about two seconds, before a potentially damaging event can occur."|Chap 1, Para 47|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
125|1|48|"Then Nadella describes the new ""breakthrough capability"" in which a computational actuating sensor is embedded directly in the machine, dramatically reducing the time to a preemptive shutdown: ""That logic is now running locally, so there's no cloud loop."" The ""edge"" knows immediately when the machine experiences an event that predicts a future anomaly, and it shuts down the equipment within 100 milliseconds of this computation, a ""20X improvement."" This is celebrated as ""the power of the cloud working in harmony with an intelligent edge"" to *anticipate and preempt variations from the norm* ""before they happen."""|Chap 1, Para 48|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
126|1|49|"The power of machine learning develops exponentially as the devices learn from one another's experiences, feeding into and drawing upon the intelligence of the hub. In this scenario it's not that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts; it's more like there are no parts. The whole is everywhere, fully manifest in each device embedded in each machine. Nadella translates these facts into their practical application, observing that once you have lots of devices around, an ""ad hoc data center"" is created ""on a factory floor, at home, or anywhere else.... You can turn any place into a safe, AI-driven place."""|Chap 1, Para 49|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
127|1|50|"With this statement it finally becomes clear that ""safe"" means ""automatically anomaly-free."" In Nadella's factory, machine knowledge instantaneously replaces ignorance, herding all machine behavior to preestablished norms. Rather than concern for the multiplication of risk and the contagion []of failure should machine learning go awry, Nadella celebrates the synchrony and universality of certain outcomes, as every machine is the same machine marching to the same song."|Chap 1, Para 50|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
128|1|51|"Just as a century ago the logic of mass production and its top-down administration provided the template for the principles of industrial society and its wider civilizational milieu, so too is Nadella's new-age factory revealed as the proving ground for his social vision---surveillance capitalism's vision---of an instrumentarian society enabled by a new form of collective action. Machine learning is rendered here as a collective mind---a hive mind---in which each element learns and operates in concert with every other element, a model of collective action in which all the machines in a networked system move seamlessly toward confluence, all sharing the same understanding and operating in unison with maximum efficiency to achieve the same outcomes. Confluent action means that the ""freedom"" of each individual machine is surrendered to the knowledge that they share. Just as the behavioral theorists Planck, Meyer, and Skinner predicted, this sacrifice amounts to an all-out war on accidents, mistakes, and randomness in general."|Chap 1, Para 51|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
129|1|52|"Nadella takes this template of new machine relations and applies it to a more complex illustration of a human and machine system, though still in the ""economic domain."" This time it's a construction site, where human and machine behaviors are tuned to preestablished parameters determined by superiors and referred to as ""policies."" Algorithmic uncontracts apply rules and substitute for social functions such as supervision, negotiation, communication, and problem solving. Each person and piece of equipment takes a place among an equivalence of objects, each one ""recognizable"" to ""the system"" through the AI devices distributed across the site."|Chap 1, Para 52|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM
130|1|53|"For example, each individual's training, credentials, employment history, and other background information are instantly on display to the system.

These are the settings where the architecture and velocities of instrumentarian power are readied for translation to society in a digital-age iteration of *Walden Two* in which machine relations are the model for social relations. Nadella's construction site exemplifies the grand confluence in which machines and humans are united as objects in the cloud, all instrumented and orchestrated in accordance with the ""policies."" The magnificence of ""policies"" lies precisely in the fact that they appear on the scene as guaranteed outcomes to be automatically imposed, monitored, and maintained by the ""system."" They are baked into Big Other's operations, an infinity of uncontracts detached from any of the social processes associated with private or public governance: conflict and negotiation, promise and compromise, agreement and shared values, democratic contest, legitimation, and authority."|Chap 1, Para 56|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM

It ensures that doors will be locked or unlocked, car engines will shut down or come to life, the jackhammer will scream ""no"" in suicidal self-sacrifice, the worker will adhere to norms, the group will swarm to defeat anomalies. We will all be safe as each organism hums in harmony with every other organism, less a society than a population []that ebbs and flows in perfect frictionless confluence, shaped by the means of behavioral modification that elude our awareness and thus can neither be mourned nor resisted."|Chap 1, Para 57|01 AUGUST 9, 2011: SETTING THE STAGE FOR SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM

In the twentieth century the critical success factors of industrial capitalism---efficiency, productivity, standardization, interchangeability, the minute division of labor, discipline, attention, scheduling, conformity, hierarchical administration, the separation of knowing and doing, and so forth---were discovered and crafted in the workplace and then transposed to society, where they were institutionalized in schools, hospitals, family life, and personality.

Skinner imagined that with the correct technology of behavior, knowledge could preemptively eliminate anomalies, driving all behavior toward preestablished parameters that align with social norms and objectives.

First, Silicon Valley pioneer Apple promised a digital dream of new solutions to old economic and social problems, and finally surpassed Exxon Mobil as the world's most highly capitalized corporation. Second, a fatal police shooting in London sparked extensive rioting across the city, engulfing the country in a wave of violent protests. A decade of explosive digital growth had failed to mitigate the punishing austerity of neoliberal economics and the extreme inequality that it produced. Too many people had come to feel excluded from the future, embracing rage and violence as their only remedies. Third, Spanish citizens asserted their rights to a human future when they challenged Google by demanding ""the right to be forgotten."" This milestone alerted the world to how quickly the cherished dreams of a more just and democratic digital future were shading into nightmare, and it foreshadowed a global political contest over the fusion of digital capabilities and capitalist ambitions.

152|2|4|Apple thundered onto the music scene in the midst of a pitched battle between demand and supply. On one side were young people whose enthusiasm for Napster and other forms of music file sharing expressed a new quality of demand: consumption my way, what I want, when I want it, where I want it. On the other side were music-industry executives who chose to instill fear and to crush that demand by hunting down and prosecuting some of Napster's most-ardent users. Apple bridged the divide with a commercially and legally viable solution that aligned the company with the changing needs of individuals while working with industry incumbents. Napster hacked the music industry, but Apple appeared to have hacked capitalism.|Chap 2, Para 4|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
153|2|5|"It is easy to forget just how dramatic Apple's hack really was. The company's profits soared largely on the strength of its iPod/iTunes/iPhone sales. *Bloomberg Businessweek* described Wall Street analysts as ""befuddled"" by this mysterious Apple ""miracle."" As one gushed, ""We can't even model out some of the possibilities.... It's like a religion."" Even today the figures are staggering: three days after the launch of the Windows-compatible iTunes platform in October 2003, listeners downloaded a million copies of the free iTunes software and paid for a million songs, prompting Steve Jobs to announce, ""In less than one week we've broken every record and become the largest online music company in the world."" Within a month there were five million downloads, then ten million three months later, then twenty-five million three months after that. Four and a half years later, in January 2007, that number rose to two billion, and six years later, in 2013, it was 25 billion. In 2008 Apple surpassed Walmart as the world's largest music retailer. iPod sales were similarly spectacular, exploding from 1 million units per month after the music store's launch to 100 million less than four years later, when Apple subsumed the iPod's functions in its revolutionary iPhone, which drove another step-function of growth. A 2017 study of stock market returns []concluded that Apple had generated more profit for investors than any other US company in the previous century."|Chap 2, Para 5|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
154|2|6|"One hundred years before the iPod, mass production provided the gateway to a new era when it revealed a parallel universe of economic value hidden in new and still poorly understood mass consumers who wanted goods, but at a price they could afford. Henry Ford reduced the price of an automobile by 60 percent with a revolutionary industrial logic that combined high volume and low unit cost. He called it ""mass production,"" summarized in his famous maxim ""You can have any color car you want so long as it's black."""|Chap 2, Para 6|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
155|2|7|"Later, GM's Alfred Sloan expounded on that principle: ""By the time we have a product to show them \[consumers\], we are necessarily committed to selling that product because of the tremendous investment involved in bringing it to market."" The music industry's business model was built on telling its consumers what they would buy, just like Ford and Sloan. Executives invested in the production and distribution of CDs, and it was the CD that customers would have to purchase."|Chap 2, Para 7|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
156|2|8|Henry Ford was among the first to strike gold by tapping into the new mass consumption with the Model T. As in the case of the iPod, Ford's Model T factory was pressed to meet the immediate explosion of demand. Mass production could be applied to anything, and it was. It changed the framework of production as it diffused throughout the economy and around the world, and it established the dominance of a new mass-production capitalism as the basis for wealth creation in the twentieth century.|Chap 2, Para 8|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
157|2|9|The iPod/iTunes innovations flipped this century-old industrial logic, leveraging the new capabilities of digital technologies to *invert* the consumption experience. Apple rewrote the relationship between listeners and their music with a distinct commercial logic that, while familiar to us now, was also experienced as revolutionary when first introduced.|Chap 2, Para 9|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
158|2|10|The Apple inversion depended on a few key elements. Digitalization made it possible to *rescue* valued assets---in this case, songs---from the institutional spaces in which they were trapped. The costly institutional procedures that Sloan had described were eliminated in favor of a direct route to listeners. In the case of the CD, for example, Apple *bypassed* the physical production of the product along with its packaging, inventory, storage, marketing, transportation, distribution, and physical retailing. The combination []of the iTunes platform and the iPod device made it possible for listeners to continuously *reconfigure* their songs at will. No two iPods were the same, and an iPod one week was different from the same iPod another week, as listeners decided and re-decided the dynamic pattern. It was an excruciating development for the music industry and its satellites---retailers, marketers, etc.---but it was exactly what the new listeners wanted.|Chap 2, Para 10|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
159|2|11|"How should we understand this success? Apple's ""miracle"" is typically credited to its design and marketing genius. Consumers' eagerness to have ""what I want, when, where, and how I want it"" is taken as evidence of the demand for ""convenience"" and sometimes even written off as narcissism or petulance. In my view, these explanations pale against the unprecedented magnitude of Apple's accomplishments. We have contented ourselves for too long with superficial explanations of Apple's unprecedented fusion of capitalism and the digital rather than digging deeper into the historical forces that summoned this new form to life."|Chap 2, Para 11|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
160|2|12|Just as Ford tapped into a new mass consumption, Apple was among the first to experience explosive commercial success by tapping into a new society of individuals and their demand for individualized consumption. The inversion implied a larger story of a commercial reformation in which the digital era finally offered the tools to shift the focus of consumption from the mass to the individual, liberating and reconfiguring capitalism's operations and assets. It promised something utterly new, urgently necessary, and operationally impossible outside the networked spaces of the digital. Its implicit promise of an advocacy-oriented alignment with our new needs and values was a confirmation of our inner sense of dignity and worth, ratifying the feeling that we matter. In offering consumers respite from an institutional world that was indifferent to their individual needs, it opened the door to the possibility of a new rational capitalism able to reunite supply and demand by connecting us to what we really want in exactly the ways that we choose.|Chap 2, Para 12|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
161|2|13|As I shall argue in the coming chapters, the same historical conditions that sent the iPod on its wild ride summoned the emancipatory promise of the internet into our everyday lives as we sought remedies for inequality and exclusion. Of most significance for our story, these same conditions would provide important shelter for surveillance capitalism's ability to root and flourish. More precisely, the Apple miracle and surveillance capitalism each []owes its success to the destructive collision of two opposing historical forces. One vector belongs to the longer history of modernization and the centuries-long societal shift from the mass to the individual. The opposing vector belongs to the decades-long elaboration and implementation of the neoliberal economic paradigm: its political economics, its transformation of society, and especially its aim to reverse, subdue, impede, and even destroy the individual urge toward psychological the basic contours of this collision, establishing terms of reference that we will return to throughout the coming chapters as we explore surveillance capitalism's rapid rise to dominance.|Chap 2, Para 13|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
162|2|14|"Capitalism evolves in response to the needs of people in a time and place. Henry Ford was clear on this point: ""Mass production begins in the perception of a public need."" At a time when the Detroit automobile manufacturers were preoccupied with luxury vehicles, Ford stood alone in his recognition of a nation of newly modernizing individuals---farmers, wage earners, and shopkeepers---who had little and wanted much, but at a price they could afford. Their ""demand"" issued from the same conditions of existence that summoned Ford and his men as they discovered the transformational power of a new logic of standardized, high-volume, low-unit-cost production. Ford's famous ""five-dollar day"" was emblematic of a systemic logic of reciprocity. In paying assembly-line workers higher wages than anyone had yet imagined, he recognized that the whole enterprise of mass production rested upon a thriving population of mass consumers."|Chap 2, Para 14|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
163|2|15|Although the market form and its bosses had many failings and produced many violent facts, its populations of newly modernizing individuals were valued as the necessary sources of customers and employees. It depended upon its communities in ways that would eventually lead to a range of institutionalized reciprocities. On the outside the drama of access to affordable goods and services was bound by democratic measures and methods of oversight that asserted and protected the rights and safety of workers and consumers. On the inside were durable employment systems, career ladders, []and steady increases in wages and benefits. Indeed, considered from the vantage point of the last forty years, during which this market form was systematically deconstructed, its reciprocity with the social order, however vexed and imperfect, appears to have been one of its most-salient features.|Chap 2, Para 15|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
164|2|16|"The implication is that new market forms are most productive when they are shaped by an allegiance to the actual demands and mentalities of people. The great sociologist Emile Durkheim made this point at the dawn of the twentieth century, and his insight will be a touchstone for us throughout this book. Observing the dramatic upheavals of industrialization in his time---factories, specialization, the complex division of labor---Durkheim understood that although economists could describe these developments, they could not grasp their *cause.* He argued that these sweeping changes were ""caused"" by the changing needs of people and that economists were (and remain) systematically blind to these social facts:"|Chap 2, Para 16|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
165|2|17|:::  The division of labor appears to us otherwise than it does to economists. For them, it essentially consists in greater production. For us, this greater productivity is only a necessary consequence, a repercussion of the phenomenon. If we specialize, it is not to produce more, but it is to enable us to live in the *new conditions of existence* that have been made for us. :::|Chap 2, Para 17|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
166|2|18|"The sociologist identified the perennial human quest to live effectively in our ""conditions of existence"" as the invisible causal power that summons the division of labor, technologies, work organization, capitalism, and ultimately civilization itself. Each is forged in the same crucible of human need that is produced by what Durkheim called the always intensifying ""violence of the struggle"" for effective life: ""If work becomes more divided,"" it is because the ""struggle for existence is more acute."" The rationality of capitalism reflects this alignment, however imperfect, with the needs that people experience as they try to live their lives effectively, struggling with the conditions of existence that they encounter in their time and place."|Chap 2, Para 18|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
167|2|19|"When we look through this lens, we can see that those eager customers for Ford's incredible Model T and the new consumers of iPods and iPhones are expressions of the conditions of existence that characterized their era. In []fact, each is the fruit of distinct phases of a centuries-long process known as ""individualization"" that is the human signature of the modern era. Ford's mass consumers were members of what has been called the ""first modernity,"" but the new conditions of the ""second modernity"" produced a new kind of individual for whom the Apple inversion, and the many digital innovations that followed, would become essential. This second modernity summoned the likes of Google and Facebook into our lives, and, in an unexpected twist, helped to enable the surveillance capitalism that would follow."|Chap 2, Para 19|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
168|2|20|"What are these modernities and how do they matter to our story? The advent of the individual as the locus of moral agency and choice initially occurred in the West, where the conditions for this emergence first took hold. First let's establish that the concept of ""individualization"" should not be confused with the neoliberal ideology of ""individualism"" that shifts all responsibility for success or failure to a mythical, atomized, isolated individual, doomed to a life of perpetual competition and disconnected from relationships, community, and society. Neither does it refer to the psychological process of ""individuation"" that is associated with the lifelong exploration of self-development. Instead, individualization is a consequence of long-term processes of modernization."|Chap 2, Para 20|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
169|2|21|"Until the last few minutes of human history, each life was foretold in blood and geography, sex and kin, rank and religion. I am my mother's daughter. I am my father's son. The sense of the human being as an *individual* emerged gradually over centuries, clawed from this ancient vise. Around two hundred years ago, we embarked upon the first modern road where life was no longer handed down one generation to the next according to the traditions of village and clan. This ""first modernity"" marks the time when life became ""individualized"" for great numbers of people as they separated from traditional norms, meanings, and rules. That meant each life became an open-ended reality to be discovered rather than a certainty to be enacted. Even where the traditional world remains intact for many people today, it can no longer be experienced as the only possible story."|Chap 2, Para 21|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
170|2|22|"I often think about the courage of my great-grandparents. What mixture of sadness, terror, and exhilaration did they feel when in 1908, determined to escape the torments of the Cossacks in their tiny village outside of Kiev, they packed their five children, including my four-year-old grandfather Max, and []all their belongings into a wagon and pointed the horses toward a steamer bound for America? Like millions of other pioneers of this first modernity, they escaped a still-feudal world and found themselves improvising a profoundly new kind of life. Max would later marry Sophie and build a family far from the rhythms of the villages that birthed them. The Spanish poet Antonio Machado captured the exhilaration and daring of these first-modernity individuals in his famous song: ""Traveler, there is no road; the road is made as you go."" This is what ""search"" has meant: a journey of exploration and self-creation, not an instant swipe to already composed answers."|Chap 2, Para 22|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS

You were expected to do what you were *supposed* to do, and little by little you made your way. You raised a nice family, and eventually you'd have a house, car, washing machine, and refrigerator.

One was expected to suppress any sense of self that spilled over the edges of the given social role, even at considerable psychic cost. Socialization and adaptation were the materials of a psychology and sociology that regarded the nuclear family as the ""factory"" for the ""production of personalities"" ready-made for conformity to the social norms of mass society. Those ""factories"" also produced a great deal of pain: the feminine mystique, closeted homosexuals, church-going atheists, and back-alley abortions. Eventually, though, they even produced people like you and me."|Chap 2, Para 25|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS

I was not alone; the road was filled with so many others on the same kind of journey. The first modernity birthed us, but we brought a new mentality to life: a ""second modernity."" What began as a modern migration from traditional lifeways bloomed into a new society of people born to a sense of psychological individuality, with its double-edged birthright of liberation and necessity. We experience both the right and the requirement to choose our own lives. No longer content to be anonymous members of the mass, we feel our entitlement to self-determination, an obvious truth to us that would have been an impossible act of hubris for Sophie and Max.

Industrialization modernity and the practices of mass production capitalism at its core produced more wealth than had ever been imagined possible. Where democratic politics, distributional policies, access to education and health care, and strong civil society institutions complemented that wealth, a new ""society of individuals"" first began to emerge. Hundreds of millions of people gained access to experiences that had once been the preserve of a tiny elite: university education, travel, improved life expectancy, disposable income, rising standards of living, broad access to consumer goods, varied communication and information flows, and specialized, intellectually demanding work."|Chap 2, Para 27|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
176|2|28|The hierarchical social compact and mass society of the first modernity promised predictable rewards, but their very success was the knife that cut us loose and sent us tumbling onto the shores of the second modernity, propelling us toward more-intricate and richly patterned lives. Education and knowledge work increased mastery of language and thought, the tools with which we create personal meaning and form our own opinions. Communication, information, consumption, and travel stimulated individual self-consciousness and imaginative capabilities, informing perspectives, values, and attitudes in ways that could no longer be contained by predefined roles or group identity. Improved health and longer life spans provided the time []for a self-life to deepen and mature, fortifying the legitimacy of personal identity over and against a priori social norms.|Chap 2, Para 28|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
177|2|29|"Even when we revert to traditional roles, these are choices now rather than absolute truths imposed at birth. As the great clinician of identity, Erik Erikson, once described it, ""The patient of today suffers most under the problem of what he should believe and who he should---or... might---be or become; while the patient of early psychoanalysis suffered most under inhibitions which prevented him from being what and who he thought he knew he was."" This new mentality has been most pronounced in wealthier countries, but research shows significant pluralities of second-modernity individuals in nearly every region of the world."|Chap 2, Para 29|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
178|2|30|The first modernity suppressed the growth and expression of self in favor of collective solutions, but by the second modernity, the self is all we have. The new sense of psychological sovereignty broke upon the world long before the internet appeared to amplify its claims. We learn through trial and error how to stitch together our lives. Nothing is given. Everything must be reviewed, renegotiated, and reconstructed on the terms that make sense to us: family, religion, sex, gender, morality, marriage, community, love, nature, social connections, political participation, career, food...|Chap 2, Para 30|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
179|2|31|Indeed, it was this new mentality and its demands that summoned the internet and the burgeoning information apparatus into our everyday lives. The burdens of life without a fixed destiny turned us toward the empowering information-rich resources of the new digital milieu as it offered new ways to amplify our voices and forge our own chosen patterns of connection. So profound is this phenomenon that one can say without exaggeration that the individual as the author of his or her own life is the protagonist of our age, whether we experience this fact as emancipation or affliction.|Chap 2, Para 31|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
180|2|32|Western modernity had formed around a canon of principles and laws that confer inviolable individual rights and acknowledge the sanctity of each individual life. However, it was not until the second modernity that felt experience began to catch up with formal law. This felt truth has been expressed in new demands to make *actual* in everyday life what is already established in law.|Chap 2, Para 32|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
181|2|33|In spite of its liberating potential, the second modernity was slated to become a hard place to live, and our conditions of existence today reflect this []trouble. Some of the challenges of the second modernity arise from the inevitable costs associated with the creation and sustenance of one's own life, but second-modernity instability is also the result of institutionalized shifts in economic and social policies and practices associated with the neoliberal paradigm and its rise to dominance. This far-reaching paradigm has been aimed at containing, rechanneling, and reversing the secular wave of second-modernity claims to self-determination and the habitats in which those claims can thrive. We live in this *collision* between a centuries-old story of modernization and a decades-old story of economic violence that thwarts our pursuit of effective life.|Chap 2, Para 33|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
182|2|34|"There is a rich and compelling literature that documents this turning point in economic history, and my aim here is simply to call attention to some of the themes in this larger narrative that are vital to our understanding of the collision: the condition of existence that summoned both the Apple ""miracle"" and surveillance capitalism's subsequent gestation and growth."|Chap 2, Para 34|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
183|2|35|The mid-1970s saw the postwar economic order under siege from stagnation, inflation, and sharply reduced growth, most markedly in the US and the UK. There were also new pressures on the political order as second-modernity individuals---especially students, young workers, African Americans, women, Latinos, and other marginalized groups---mobilized around demands for equal rights, voice, and participation. In the US the Vietnam War was a focal point of social unrest, and the corruption exposed by the Watergate scandal triggered public insistence on political reform. In the UK inflation had strained industrial relations beyond the breaking point. In both countries the specter of apparently intractable economic decay combined with vocal new demands on the democratic social compact produced confusion, anxiety, and desperation among elected officials ill-equipped to judge why once-reliable Keynesian policies had failed to reverse the course.|Chap 2, Para 35|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
184|2|36|"Neoliberal economists had been waiting in the wings for this opportunity, and their ideas flowed into the ""policy vacuum"" that now bedeviled both governments. Led by the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, fresh from []his 1974 Nobel Prize, and his American counterpart Milton Friedman, who received the Nobel two years later, they had honed their radical free-market economic theory, political ideology, and pragmatic agenda throughout the postwar period at the fringe of their profession, under the shadow of Keynesian domination, and now their time had come."|Chap 2, Para 36|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
185|2|37|"The free-market creed originated in Europe as a sweeping defense against the threat of totalitarian and communist collectivist ideologies. It aimed to revive acceptance of a self-regulating market as a natural force of such complexity and perfection that it demanded radical freedom from all forms of state oversight. Hayek explained the necessity of absolute individual and collective submission to the exacting disciplines of the market as an unknowable ""extended order"" that supersedes the legitimate political authority vested in the state: ""Modern economics explains how such an extended order... constitutes an information-gathering process... that no central planning agency, let alone any individual, could know as a whole, possess, or control...."" Hayek and his ideological brethren insisted on a capitalism stripped down to its raw core, unimpeded by any other force and impervious to any external authority. Inequality of wealth and rights was accepted and even celebrated as a necessary feature of a successful market system and as a force for progress. Hayek's ideology provided the intellectual superstructure and legitimation for a new theory of the firm that became another crucial antecedent to the surveillance capitalist corporation: its structure, moral content, and relationship to society."|Chap 2, Para 37|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
186|2|38|"The new conception was operationalized by economists Michael Jensen and William Meckling. Leaning heavily on Hayek's work, the two scholars took an ax to the pro-social principles of the twentieth-century corporation, an ax that became known as the ""shareholder value movement."" In 1976 Jensen and Meckling published a landmark article in which they reinterpreted the manager as a sort of parasite feeding off the host of ownership: unavoidable, perhaps, but nonetheless an obstacle to shareholder wealth. They boldly argued that structural disconnect between owners and managers ""can result in the value of the firm being substantially lower than it otherwise could be."" If managers suboptimized the value of the firm to its owners in favor of their own preferences and comfort, it was only rational for them to do so. The solution, these economists argued, was to assert the market's signal of value, []the share price, as the basis for a new incentive structure intended to finally and decisively align managerial behavior with owners' interests. Managers who failed to bend to the ineffable signals of Hayek's ""extended order"" would quickly become prey to the ""barbarians at the gate"" in a new and vicious hunt for unrealized market value."|Chap 2, Para 38|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
187|2|39|"In the ""crisis of democracy"" zeitgeist, the neoliberal vision and its reversion to market metrics was deeply attractive to politicians and policy makers, both as the means to evade political ownership of tough economic choices and because it promised to impose a new kind of *order* where disorder was feared. The absolute authority of market forces would be enshrined as the ultimate source of imperative control, displacing democratic contest and deliberation with an ideology of atomized individuals sentenced to perpetual competition for scarce resources. The disciplines of competitive markets promised to quiet unruly individuals and even transform them back into subjects too preoccupied with survival to complain."|Chap 2, Para 39|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
188|2|40|As the old collectivist enemies had receded, new ones took their place: state regulation and oversight, social legislation and welfare policies, labor unions and the institutions of collective bargaining, and the principles of democratic politics. Indeed, all these were to be replaced by the market's version of truth, and competition would be the solution to growth. The new aims would be achieved through supply-side reforms, including deregulation, privatization, and lower taxes.|Chap 2, Para 40|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
189|2|41|"Thirty-five years before Hayek and Friedman's ascendance, the great historian Karl Polanyi wrote eloquently on the rise of the market economy. Polanyi's studies led him to conclude that the operations of a self-regulating market are profoundly destructive when allowed to run free of countervailing laws and policies. He described the *double movement:* ""a network of measures and policies... integrated into powerful institutions designed to check the action of the market relative to labor, land, and money."""|Chap 2, Para 41|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
190|2|42|The double movement, Polanyi argued, supports the market form while tethering it to society: balancing, moderating, and mitigating its destructive excesses. Polanyi observed that such countermeasures emerged spontaneously in every European society during the second half of the nineteenth century. Each constructed legislative, regulatory, and institutional solutions to oversee contested new arenas such as workers' compensation, factory []inspection, municipal trading, public utilities, food safety, child labor, and public safety.|Chap 2, Para 42|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
191|2|43|In the US the double movement was achieved through decades of social contest that harnessed industrial production, however imperfectly, to society's needs. It appeared in the trust busting, civil society, and legislative reforms of the Progressive Era. Later it was elaborated in the legislative, juridical, social, and tax initiatives of the New Deal and the institutionalization of Keynesian economics during the post--World War II era: labor market, tax, and social welfare policies that ultimately increased economic and social equality. The double movement was further developed in the legislative initiatives of the Great Society, especially civil rights law and landmark environmental legislation. Many scholars credit such countermeasures with the success of market democracy in the US and Europe, a political economics that proved far more adaptive in its ability to produce reciprocities of demand and supply than either leftist theorists or even Polanyi had imagined, and by mid-century the large corporation appeared to be a deeply rooted and durable modern social institution.|Chap 2, Para 43|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
192|2|44|"The double movement was scheduled for demolition under the neoliberal flag, and implementation began immediately. In 1976, the same year that Jensen and Meckling published their pathbreaking analysis, President Jimmy Carter initiated the first significant efforts to radically align the corporation with Wall Street's market metrics, targeting the deregulation. What began as a ""ripple"" turned into ""a tidal wave that washed away controls from large segments of the economy in the last two decades of the twentieth century."" The implementation that began with Carter would define the Reagan and Thatcher eras, virtually every subsequent US presidency, and much of the rest of the world, as the new fiscal and social policies spread to Europe and other regions in varying degrees."|Chap 2, Para 44|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
193|2|45|"Thus began the disaggregation and diminishment of the US public firm. The public corporation as a social institution was reinterpreted as a costly error, and its long-standing reciprocities with customers and employees were recast as destructive violations of market efficiency. Financial carrots and sticks persuaded executives to dismember and shrink their companies, and the logic []of capitalism shifted from the profitable production of goods and services to increasingly exotic forms of financial speculation. The disciplines imposed by the new market operations stripped capitalism down to its raw core, and by 1989 Jensen confidently proclaimed the ""eclipse of the public corporation."""|Chap 2, Para 45|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
194|2|46|"By the turn of the century, as the foundational mechanisms of surveillance capitalism were just beginning to take shape, ""shareholder value maximization"" was widely accepted as the ""objective function"" of the firm. These principles, culled from a once-extremist philosophy, were canonized as standard practice across commercial, financial, and legal domains. By 2000, US public corporations employed fewer than half as many Americans as they did in 1970. In 2009 there were only half as many public firms as in 1997. The public corporation had become ""unnecessary for production, unsuited for stable employment and the provision of social welfare services, and incapable of proving a reliable long-term return on investment."" In this process the cult of the ""entrepreneur"" would rise to near-mythic prominence as the perfect union of ownership and management, replacing the rich existential possibilities of the second modernity with a single glorified template of audacity, competitive cunning, dominance, and wealth."|Chap 2, Para 46|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
195|2|47|"On August 9, 2011, around the same time that cheers erupted in Apple's conference room, 16,000 police officers flooded the streets of London, determined to quell ""the most widespread and prolonged breakdown of order in London's history since the Gordon riot of 1780."" The rioting had begun four nights earlier when a peaceful vigil triggered by the police shooting of a young man suddenly turned violent. In the days that followed, the number of rioters swelled as looting and arson spread to twenty-two of London's thirty-two boroughs and other major cities across Britain. Over four days of street action, thousands of people caused property damage of over \$50 million, and 3,000 people were arrested."|Chap 2, Para 47|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
196|2|48|"Even as Apple's ascension appeared to ratify the claims of second-modernity individuals, the streets of London told the grim legacy of a []three-decade experiment in economic growth through exclusion. One week after the rioting, an article by sociologist Saskia Sassen in the *Daily Beast* observed that ""if there's one underlying condition, it has to do with the unemployment and bitter poverty among people who desire to be part of the middle class and who are keenly aware of the sharp inequality between themselves and their country's wealthy elite. These are in many ways social revolutions with a small 'r,' protests against social conditions that have become unbearable."""|Chap 2, Para 48|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
197|2|49|"What were the social conditions that had become so *unbearable?* Many analysts agreed that the tragedy of Britain's riots was set into motion by neoliberalism's successful transformation of society: a program that was most comprehensively executed in the UK and the US. Indeed, research from the London School of Economics based on interviews with 270 people who had participated in the rioting reported on the predominant theme of inequality: ""no job, no money."" The terms of reference in nearly every study sound the same drumbeat: lack of opportunity, lack of access to education, marginalization, deprivation, grievance, hopelessness. And although the London riots differed substantially from other protests that preceded and followed, most notably the Indignados movement that began with a large-scale public mobilization in Madrid in May 2011 and the Occupy movement that would emerge on September 17 in Wall Street's Zuccotti Park, they shared a point of origin in the themes of economic inequality and exclusion."|Chap 2, Para 49|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
198|2|50|"The US, the UK, and most of Europe entered the second decade of the twenty-first century facing economic and social inequalities more extreme than anything since the Gilded Age and comparable to some of the world's poorest countries. Despite a decade of explosive digital growth that included the Apple miracle and the penetration of the internet into everyday life, dangerous social divisions suggested an even more stratified and antidemocratic future. ""In the age of new consensus financial policy stabilization,"" one US economist wrote, ""the economy has witnessed the largest transfer of income to the top in history."" A sobering 2016 report from the International Monetary Fund warned of instability, concluding that the global trends toward neoliberalism ""have not delivered as expected."" Instead, inequality had significantly diminished ""the level and the durability of growth"" while increasing volatility and creating permanent vulnerability to economic crisis."|Chap 2, Para 50|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
199|2|51|"[]The quest for effective life had been driven to the breaking point under the aegis of market freedom. Two years after the North London riots, research in the UK showed that by 2013, poverty fueled by lack of education and unemployment already excluded nearly a third of the population from routine social participation. Another UK report concluded, ""Workers on low and middle incomes are experiencing the biggest decline in their living standards since reliable records began in the mid-19th Century."" By 2015, austerity measures had eliminated 19 percent, or 18 billion pounds, from the budgets of local authorities, had forced an 8 percent cut in child protection spending, and had caused 150,000 pensioners to no longer enjoy access to vital services. Buy 2014 nearly half of the US population lived in functional poverty, with the highest wage in the bottom half of earners at about \$34,000. A 2012 US Department of Agriculture survey showed that close to 49 million people lived in ""food-insecure"" households."|Chap 2, Para 51|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
200|2|52|"In *Capital in the Twenty-First Century,* the French economist Thomas Piketty integrated years of income data to derive a general law of accumulation: the rate of return on capital tends to exceed the rate of economic growth. This tendency, summarized as *r \> g,* is a dynamic that produces ever-more-extreme income divergence and with it a range of antidemocratic social consequences long predicted as harbingers of an eventual crisis of capitalism. In this context, Piketty cites the ways in which financial elites use their outsized earnings to fund a cycle of political capture that protects their interests from political challenge. Indeed, a 2015 *New York Times* report concluded that 158 US families and their corporations provided almost half (\$176 million) of all the money that was raised by both political parties in support of presidential candidates in 2016, primarily in support of ""Republican candidates who have pledged to pare regulations, cut taxes... and shrink entitlements."" Historians, investigative journalists, economists, and political scientists have analyzed the intricate facts of a turn toward oligarchy, shining a light on the systematic campaigns of public influence and political capture that helped drive and preserve an extreme free-market agenda at the expense of democracy."|Chap 2, Para 52|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
201|2|53|"A précis of Piketty's extensive research may be stated simply: *capitalism should not be eaten raw.* Capitalism, like sausage, is meant to be cooked by a democratic society and its institutions because raw capitalism is antisocial. As Piketty warns, ""A market economy... if left to itself... contains powerful []forces of divergence, which are potentially threatening to democratic societies and to the values of social justice on which they are based."" Many scholars have taken to describing these new conditions as *neofeudalism,* marked by the consolidation of elite wealth and power far beyond the control of ordinary people and the mechanisms of democratic consent. Piketty calls it a return to ""patrimonial capitalism,"" a reversion to a premodern society in which one's life chances depend upon inherited wealth rather than meritocratic achievement."|Chap 2, Para 53|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
202|2|54|"We now have the tools to grasp the collision in all of its destructive complexity: *what is unbearable is that economic and social inequalities have reverted to the preindustrial ""feudal"" pattern but that we, the people, have not.* We are not illiterate peasants, serfs, or slaves. Whether ""middle class"" or ""marginalized,"" we share the collective historical condition of individualized persons with complex social experiences and opinions. We are hundreds of millions or even billions of second-modernity people whom history has freed both from the once-immutable facts of a destiny told at birth and from the conditions of mass society. We know ourselves to be worthy of dignity and the opportunity to live an effective life. This is existential toothpaste that, once liberated, cannot be squeezed back into the tube.

203|2|55|"Back in 2011, those 270 interviews of London participants in the riots also reflected the scars of this collision. ""They expressed it in different ways,"" the report concludes, ""but at heart what the rioters talked about was a pervasive sense of injustice. For some, this was economic---the lack of a job, money, or opportunity. For others it was more broadly social, not just the absence of material things, but how they felt they were treated compared with others...."" The ""sense of being invisible"" was ""widespread."" As one woman explained, ""The young these days *need to be heard.* It's got to be justice for them.""

The 99 percent that Occupy intended to represent is not marginalized; on the contrary, the very legitimacy of Occupy was its claim to supermajority status. Nevertheless, Occupy revealed a similar conflict between inequality's facts and inequality's feelings, expressed in a creatively individualized political culture that insisted on ""direct democracy"" and ""horizontal leadership."" Some analysts concluded that it was this conflict that ultimately crippled the movement, with its ""inner core"" of leaders unwilling to compromise their highly individualized approach in favor of the strategies and tactics required for a durable mass movement. However, one thing is certain: there were no serfs in Zuccotti Park. On the contrary, as one close observer of the movement ruminated, ""What is different is that than our rulers.

Individualization has sent each one of us on the prowl for the resources we need to ensure effective life, but at each turn we are forced to do battle with an economics and politics from whose vantage point we are but ciphers. We live in the knowledge that our lives have unique value, but we are treated as invisible. As the rewards of late-stage financial capitalism slip beyond our grasp, we are left to contemplate the future in a bewilderment that erupts into violence with increasing frequency. Our expectations of psychological self-determination are the grounds upon which our dreams unfold, so the losses we experience in the slow burn of rising inequality, exclusion, pervasive competition, and degrading stratification are not only economic.

Any new chapter in []the centuries-old story of human emancipation, he insisted, must begin here.

217|2|69|"The digital milieu has been essential to these degradations. Kim points out that paper documents once imposed natural restraints on contracting behavior simply by virtue of their cost to produce, distribute, and archive. Paper contracts require a physical signature, limiting the burden a firm is likely to impose on a customer by requiring her to read multiple pages of fine print. Digital terms, in contrast, are ""weightless."" They can be expanded, reproduced, distributed, and archived at no additional cost. Once firms understood that the courts were disposed to validate their click-wrap and browse-wrap agreements, there was nothing to stop them from expanding the reach of these degraded contracts ""to extract from consumers additional benefits unrelated to the transaction."" This coincided with the discovery of behavioral surplus that we examine in [Chapter 3](chapter003.xhtml), as terms-of-service agreements were extended to include baroque and perverse ""privacy policies,"" []establishing another infinite regress of these terms of expropriation. Even the former Federal Trade Commission Chairperson Jon Leibowitz publicly stated, ""We all agree that consumers don't read privacy policies."" In 2008 two Carnegie Mellon professors calculated that a reasonable reading of all the privacy policies that one encounters in a year would require 76 full workdays at a national opportunity cost of \$781 billion. The numbers are much higher today. Still, most users remain unaware of these ""rapacious"" terms that, as Kim puts it, allow firms ""to acquire rights without bargaining and to stealthily establish and embed practices before users, and regulators, realize what has happened."""|Chap 2, Para 69|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
218|2|70|At first, it had seemed that the new internet companies had simply failed to grasp the moral, social, and institutional requirements of their own economic logic. But with each corporate transgression, it became more difficult to ignore the possibility that the pattern of violations signaled a feature, not a bug. Although the Apple miracle contained the seeds of economic reformation, it was poorly understood: a mystery even to itself. Long before the death of its legendary founder, Steve Jobs, its frequent abuses of user expectations raised questions about how well the corporation understood the deep structure and historic potential of its own creations. The dramatic success of Apple's iPod and iTunes instilled internet users with a sense of optimism toward the new digital capitalism, but Apple never did seize the reins on developing the consistent, comprehensive social and institutional processes that would have elevated the iPod's promise to an explicit market form, as Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan had once done.|Chap 2, Para 70|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
219|2|71|"These developments reflect the simple truth that genuine economic reformation takes time and that the internet world, its investors and shareholders, were and are in a hurry. The credo of digital innovation quickly turned to the language of disruption and an obsession with speed, its campaigns conducted under the flag of ""creative destruction."" That famous, fateful phrase coined by evolutionary economist Joseph Schumpeter was seized upon as a way to legitimate what Silicon Valley euphemistically calls ""permissionless innovation."" Destruction rhetoric promoted what I think of as a ""boys and their toys"" theory of history, as if the winning hand in capitalism is about blowing things up with new technologies. Schumpeter's analysis was, in fact, far more nuanced and complex than modern destruction rhetoric suggests."|Chap 2, Para 71|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
220|2|72|"[]Although Schumpeter regarded capitalism as an ""evolutionary"" process, he also considered that relatively few of its continuous innovations actually rise to the level of evolutionary significance. These rare events are what he called ""mutations."" These are enduring, sustainable, qualitative shifts in the logic, understanding, and practice of capitalist accumulation, not random, temporary, or opportunistic reactions to circumstances. Schumpeter insisted that this evolutionary mechanism is triggered by new consumer needs, and alignment with those needs is the discipline that drives sustainable mutation: ""The capitalist process, not by coincidence but by virtue of its mechanism, progressively raises the standard of life of the masses."""|Chap 2, Para 72|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
221|2|73|"If a mutation is to be reliably sustained, its new aims and practices must be translated into new institutional forms: ""The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers' goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates."" Note that Schumpeter says ""creates,"" not ""destroys."" As an example of mutation, Schumpeter cites ""the stages of organizational development from the craft shop to the factory to a complex corporation like U.S. Steel...."""|Chap 2, Para 73|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
222|2|74|"Schumpeter understood creative destruction as one unfortunate by-product of a long and complex process of creative sustainable change. ""Capitalism,"" he wrote, *""creates and destroys.""* Schumpeter was adamant on this point: ""Creative response shapes the whole course of subsequent events and their 'long-run' outcome.... Creative response changes social and economic situations for good.... This is why creative response is an essential element in the historical process: No deterministic credo avails against this."" Finally, and contrary to the rhetoric of Silicon Valley and its worship of speed, Schumpeter argued that genuine mutation demands patience: ""We are dealing with a process whose every element takes considerable time in revealing its true features and ultimate effects.... We must judge its performance over time, as it unfolds through decades or centuries."""|Chap 2, Para 74|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
223|2|75|"The significance of a ""mutation"" in Schumpeter's reckoning implies a high threshold, one that is crossed in time through the serious work of inventing new institutional forms embedded in the new needs of new people. Relatively little destruction is creative, especially in the absence of a robust []double movement. This is illustrated in Schumpeter's example of US Steel, founded by some of the Gilded Age's most notorious ""robber barons,"" including Andrew Carnegie and J. P. Morgan. Under pressure from an increasingly insistent double movement, US Steel eventually institutionalized fair labor practices through unions and collective bargaining as well as internal labor markets, career ladders, professional hierarchies, employment security, training, and development, all while implementing its technological advances in mass production."|Chap 2, Para 75|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
224|2|76|"Mutation is not a fairy tale; it is rational capitalism, bound in reciprocities with its populations through democratic institutions. Mutations fundamentally change the nature of capitalism by shifting it in the direction of those it is supposed to serve. This sort of thinking is not nearly as sexy or exciting as the ""boys and their toys"" gambit would have us think, but this is what it will take to move the dial of economic history beyond the collision and toward modernity."|Chap 2, Para 76|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
225|2|77|"A new breed of economic power swiftly filled the void in which every casual search, like, and click was claimed as an asset to be tracked, parsed, and monetized by some company, all within a decade of the iPod's debut. It was as if a shark had been silently circling the depths all along, just below the surface of the action, only to occasionally leap glistening from the water in pursuit of a fresh bite of flesh. Eventually, companies began to explain these violations as the necessary quid pro quo for ""free"" internet services. Privacy, they said, was the price one must pay for the abundant rewards of information, connection, and other digital goods when, where, and how you want them. These explanations distracted us from the sea change that would rewrite the rules of capitalism and the digital world."|Chap 2, Para 77|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
226|2|78|"In retrospect, we can see that the many discordant challenges to users' expectations were actually tiny peepholes into a rapidly emerging institutional form that was learning to exploit second-modernity needs and the established norms of ""growth through exclusion"" as the means to an utterly novel market project. Over time, the shark revealed itself as a rapidly []multiplying, systemic, internally consistent new variant of information capitalism that had set its sights on domination. An unprecedented formulation of capitalism was elbowing its way into history: surveillance capitalism."|Chap 2, Para 78|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
227|2|79|"This new market form is a unique logic of accumulation in which surveillance is a foundational mechanism in the transformation of investment into profit. Its rapid rise, institutional elaboration, and significant expansion challenged the tentative promise of the inversion and its advocacy-oriented values. More generally, the rise of surveillance capitalism betrayed the hopes and expectations of many ""netizens"" who cherished the emancipatory promise of the networked milieu."|Chap 2, Para 79|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
228|2|80|Surveillance capitalism commandeered the wonders of the digital world to meet our needs for effective life, promising the magic of unlimited information and a thousand ways to anticipate our needs and ease the complexities of our harried lives. We welcomed it into our hearts and homes with our own rituals of hospitality. As we shall explore in detail throughout the coming chapters, thanks to surveillance capitalism the resources for effective life that we seek in the digital realm now come encumbered with a new breed of menace. Under this new regime, the precise moment at which our needs are met is also the precise moment at which our lives are plundered for behavioral data, and all for the sake of others' gain. The result is a perverse amalgam of empowerment inextricably layered with diminishment. In the absence of a decisive societal response that constrains or outlaws this logic of accumulation, surveillance capitalism appears poised to become the dominant form of capitalism in our time.|Chap 2, Para 80|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
229|2|81|"How did this happen? It is a question that we shall return to throughout this book as we accumulate new insights and answers. For now we can recognize that over the centuries we have imagined threat in the form of state power. This left us wholly unprepared to defend ourselves from new companies with imaginative names run by young geniuses that seemed able to provide us with exactly what we yearn for at little or no cost. This new regime's most poignant harms, now and later, have been difficult to grasp or theorize, blurred by extreme velocity and camouflaged by expensive and illegible machine operations, secretive corporate practices, masterful rhetorical misdirection, and purposeful cultural misappropriation. On this road, terms whose meanings we take to be positive or at least banal---""the open internet,"" ""interoperability,"" and ""connectivity""---have been quietly harnessed to a market []process in which individuals are definitively cast as the means to others' market ends."|Chap 2, Para 81|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
230|2|82|Surveillance capitalism has taken root so quickly that, with the exception of a courageous cadre of legal scholars and technology-savvy activists, it has cunningly managed to evade our understanding and agreement. As we will discuss in more depth in [Chapter 4](chapter007.xhtml), surveillance capitalism is inconceivable outside the digital milieu, but neoliberal ideology and policy also provided the habitat in which surveillance capitalism could flourish. This ideology and its practical implementation bends second-modernity individuals to the draconian quid pro quo at the heart of surveillance capitalism's logic of accumulation, in which information and connection are ransomed for the lucrative behavioral data that fund its immense growth and profits. Any effort to interrupt or dismantle surveillance capitalism will have to contend with this larger institutional landscape that protects and sustains its operations.|Chap 2, Para 82|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
231|2|83|History offers no control groups, and we cannot say whether with different leadership, more time, or other altered circumstances Apple might have perceived, elaborated, and institutionalized the jewel in its crown as Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan had done in another era. Nor is that opportunity forever lost---far from it. We may yet see the founding of a new synthesis for a third modernity in which a genuine inversion and its social compact are institutionalized as principles of a new rational digital capitalism aligned with a society of individuals and supported by democratic institutions. The fact that Schumpeter reckoned the time line for such institutionalization in decades or even centuries lingers as a critical commentary on our larger story.|Chap 2, Para 83|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
232|2|84|These developments are all the more dangerous because they cannot be reduced to known harms---monopoly, privacy---and therefore do not easily yield to known forms of combat. The new harms we face entail challenges to the sanctity of the individual, and chief among these challenges I count the elemental rights that bear on individual sovereignty, including the *right to the future tense* and *the right to sanctuary.* Each of these rights invokes claims to individual agency and personal autonomy as essential prerequisites to freedom of will and to the very concept of democratic order.|Chap 2, Para 84|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
233|2|85|Right now, however, the extreme asymmetries of knowledge and power that have accrued to surveillance capitalism abrogate these elemental rights as our lives are unilaterally rendered as data, expropriated, and repurposed []in new forms of social control, all of it in the service of others' interests and in the absence of our awareness or means of combat. We have yet to invent the politics and new forms of collaborative action---this century's equivalent of the social movements of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries that aimed to tether raw capitalism to society---that effectively assert the people's right to a human future. And while the work of these inventions awaits us, this mobilization and the resistance it engenders will define a key battleground upon which the fight for a human future unfolds.|Chap 2, Para 85|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
234|2|86|On August 9, 2011, events ricocheted between two wildly different visions of a third modernity. One was based on the digital promise of democratized information in the context of individualized economic and social relations. The other reflected the harsh truths of mass exclusion and elite rule. But the lessons of that day had not yet been fully tallied when fresh answers---or, more modestly, the tenuous glimmers of answers as fragile as a newborn's translucent skin---rose to the surface of the world's attention gliding on scented ribbons of Spanish lavender and vanilla.|Chap 2, Para 86|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
235|2|87|In the wee hours of August 9, 2011, eighteen-year-old Maria Elena Montes sat on the cool marble floor of her family's century-old pastry shop in leche, lulled by the sunrise scuffling of the pigeons in the plaza as she waited for her trays of rum-soaked gypsy cakes to set.|Chap 2, Para 87|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
236|2|88|Pasteleria La Dulce occupied a cramped medieval building tucked into a tiny square on one of the few streets that had escaped both the wrecking ball and the influx of yuppie chic. The Montes family took care that the passing decades had no visible effect on their cherished bakery. Each morning they lovingly filled sparkling glass cases with crispy sugar-studded churros, delicate buñuelos fat with vanilla custard, tiny paper ramekins of strawberry flan, buttery mantecados, coiled ensaimadas drenched in powdered sugar, fluffy magdalenas, crunchy pestiños, and Great-Grandmother Montes's special flaó, a cake made with fresh milk cheese laced with Spanish lavender, fennel, and mint. There were almond and blood-orange tarts prepared, according []to Señora Montes, exactly as they had once been served to Queen Isabella. Olive-oil ice cream flavored with anise filled the tubs in the gleaming white freezer along the wall. An old ceiling fan cycled slowly, nudging the perfume of honey and yeast into every corner of the ageless room.|Chap 2, Para 88|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
237|2|89|Only one thing had changed. Any other August would have found Maria Elena and her family at their summer cottage nestled into a pine grove near the seaside town of Palafrugell that had been the family's refuge for generations. In 2011, however, neither the Montes nor their customers and friends would take their August holidays. The economic crisis had ripped through the country like the black plague, shrinking consumption and driving unemployment to 21 percent, the highest in the EU, and to an astonishing 46 percent among people under twenty-four years old. In Catalonia, the region that includes Barcelona, 18 percent of its 7.5 million people had fallen below the poverty line. In the summer of 2011, few could afford the simple pleasure of an August spent by the sea or in the mountains.|Chap 2, Para 89|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
238|2|90|There was new pressure to sell the building and let the future finally swallow La Dulce. The family could live comfortably on the proceeds of such a sale, even at the bargain rates they would be forced to accept. Business was slow, but Señor Fito Montes refused to lay off any members of a staff that was like an extended family after years of steady employment. Just about everyone they knew said that the end was inevitable and that the Montes should leap at the opportunity for a dignified exit. But the family was determined to make every sacrifice to safeguard Pasteleria La Dulce for the future.|Chap 2, Para 90|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
239|2|91|"Just three months earlier, Juan Pablo and Maria had made the pilgrimage to Madrid to join thousands of protesters at the Puerta del Sol, where a month-long encampment established Los Indignados, the 15M, as the new voice of a people who had finally been pushed to the breaking point by the economics of contempt. All that was left to say was ""*Ya. No mas!*"" Enough already! The convergence of so many citizens in Madrid led to a wave of protests across the nation, and eventually those protests would give way to new political parties, including Podemos. Neighborhood assemblies had begun to convene in many cities, and the Montes had attended such a meeting in El Raval just the night before."|Chap 2, Para 91|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
240|2|92|With the evening's conversations still fresh, they gathered in the apartment above the shop in the early afternoon of August 9 to share their midday []meal and discuss the fate of La Dulce, not quite certain what Papa Montes was thinking.|Chap 2, Para 92|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
241|2|93|"""The bankers may not know it,"" Fito Montes reflected, ""but the future will need the past. It will need these marble floors and the sweet taste of my gypsy cakes. They treat us like figures in a ledger, like they are reading the number of casualties in a plane crash. They believe the future belongs only to them. But we each have our story. We each have our life. It is up to us to proclaim our right to the future. The future is our home too."""|Chap 2, Para 93|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
242|2|94|Maria and Juan Pablo breathed a shared sigh of relief as they outlined their plan. Juan Pablo would withdraw temporarily from his university studies, and Maria Elena would postpone her matriculation. They would work on expanding La Dulce's sales with new home-delivery and catering options. Everyone would take a pay cut, but no one would have to leave. Everyone would tighten their belts, except the fat buñuelos and their perfect comrades steadfast in neat, delicious rows.|Chap 2, Para 94|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
243|2|95|We know how to challenge the inevitable, they said. We've survived wars; we've survived the Fascists. We'll survive again. For Fito Montes, his family's right to anticipate the future as their home demanded continuity for some things that are elusive, beautiful, surprising, mysterious, inexpressible, and immaterial but without which, they all agreed, life would be mechanical and soulless. He was determined, for example, to ensure that another generation of Spanish children would recognize the bouquet of his blood-orange tarts flecked with rose petals and thus be awakened to the mystery of medieval life in the fragrant gardens of the Alhambra.|Chap 2, Para 95|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
244|2|96|On August 9 the heat rose steadily in the shady square, and the sun emptied the avenues where Huns, Moors, Castilians, and Bourbons had each in their turn marched to triumph. Those silent streets bore little evidence of the historic deliberations in Madrid that would be featured in the *New York Times* that very day. But I imagine the two cities linked by invisible ribbons of scent rising from La Dulce high into the bleached Barcelona sky and drifting slowly south and west to settle along the austere facade of the building that housed the Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, where another struggle for the right to the future tense was underway.|Chap 2, Para 96|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
245|2|97|"The Spanish Data Protection Agency had chosen to champion the claims of ninety ordinary citizens who, like the Montes family, were determined to []preserve inherited meaning for a world bent on change at the speed of light. In the name of ""the right to be forgotten,"" the Spaniards had stepped into the bullring brandishing red capes, resolved to master the fiercest bull of all: Google, the juggernaut of surveillance capitalism. When the agency ordered the internet firm to stop indexing the contested links of these ninety individuals, the bull received one of its first and most significant blows."|Chap 2, Para 97|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
246|2|98|This official confrontation drew upon the same tenacity, determination, and sentiment that sustained the Montes family and millions of other Spaniards compelled to claw back the future from the self-proclaimed inevitability of indifferent capital. In the assertion of a right to be forgotten, the complexity of human existence, with its thousand million shades of gray, was pitted against surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives that produced the relentless drive to extract and retain information. It was there, in Spain, that the right to the future tense was on the move, insisting that the operations of surveillance capitalism and its digital architecture are not, never were, and never would be inevitable. Instead, the opposition asserted that even Google's capitalism was made by humans to be unmade and remade by democratic processes, not commercial decree. Google's was not to be the last word on the human or the digital future.|Chap 2, Para 98|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
247|2|99|Each of the ninety citizens had a unique claim. One had been terrorized by her former husband and didn't want him to find her address online. Informational privacy was essential to her peace of mind and her physical safety. A middle-aged woman was embarrassed by an old arrest from her days as a university student. Informational privacy was essential to her identity and sense of dignity. One was an attorney, Mario Costeja González, who years earlier had suffered the foreclosure of his home. Although the matter had long been resolved, a Google search of his name continued to deliver links to the foreclosure notice, which, he argued, damaged his reputation. While the Spanish Data Protection Agency rejected the idea of requiring newspapers and other originating sites to remove legitimate information---such information, they reasoned, would exist somewhere under any circumstances---it endorsed the notion that Google had responsibility and should be held to account. After all, Google had unilaterally undertaken to change the rules of the information life cycle when it decided to crawl, index, and make accessible personal details across the world wide web without asking anyone's []permission. The agency concluded that citizens had the right to request the removal of links and ordered Google to stop indexing the information and to remove existing links to its original sources.|Chap 2, Para 99|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
248|2|100|"Google's mission to ""organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful""---starting with the web---changed all of our lives. There have been enormous benefits, to be sure. But for individuals it has meant that information that would normally age and be forgotten now remains forever young, highlighted in the foreground of each person's digital identity. The Spanish Data Protection Agency recognized that not all information is worthy of immortality. Some information should be forgotten because that is only human. Unsurprisingly, Google challenged the agency's order before the Spanish High Court, which selected one of the ninety cases, that of attorney Mario Costeja González, for referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union. There, after lengthy and dramatic deliberations, the Court of Justice announced its decision to assert the right to be forgotten as a fundamental principle of EU law in May of 2014."|Chap 2, Para 100|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
249|2|101|"The Court of Justice's decision, so often reduced to the legal and technical considerations related to the deletion or de-linking of personal data, was in fact a key inflection point at which democracy began to claw back rights to the future tense from the powerful forces of a new surveillance capitalism determined to claim unilateral authority over the digital future. Instead, the court's analysis claimed the future for the human way, rejecting the inevitability of Google's search-engine technology and recognizing instead that search results are the contingent products of the specific economic interests that drive the action from within the belly of the machine: ""The operator of a search engine is liable to affect significantly the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data. In the light of the potential seriousness of the interference"" with those interests, ""it cannot be justified by merely the economic interest which the operator of such an engine has in that processing."" As legal scholars Paul M. Schwartz and Karl-Nikolaus Peifer summarized it, ""The Luxembourg Court felt that free flow of information matters, but not as much, ultimately, as the safeguarding of dignity, privacy, and data protection in the European rights regime."" The court conferred upon EU citizens the right to combat, requiring Google to establish a process for implementing users' de-linking requests and authorizing citizens to seek []recourse in democratic institutions, including ""the supervisory authority or the judicial authority, so that it carries out the necessary checks and orders the controller to take specific measures accordingly."""|Chap 2, Para 101|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS
250|2|102|"In reasserting the right to be forgotten, the court declared that decisive authority over the digital future rests with the people, their laws, and their democratic institutions. It affirmed that individuals and democratic societies can fight for their rights to the future tense and can win, even in the face of a great private power. As the human rights scholar Federico Fabbrini observed, with this vital case the European Court of Justice evolved more assertively into the role of a human rights court, stepping into ""the mine-field of human rights in the digital age...."""|Chap 2, Para 102|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS

Page defended Google's unprecedented information power with an extraordinary statement suggesting that people should trust Google more than democratic institutions: ""In general, having the data present in companies like Google is better than having it in the government with no due process to get that data, because we obviously care about our reputation. I'm not sure the government cares about that as much."" Speaking to the company's shareholders the day after the court's ruling, Eric Schmidt characterized the decision as a ""balance that was struck wrong"" in the ""collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know."""|Chap 2, Para 104|02 THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIORAL SURPLUS

As for the Spanish people, their Data Protection Agency, and the European Court of Justice, the passage of time is likely to reveal their achievements as a stirring early chapter in the longer story of our fight for a third modern that is first and foremost a human future, rooted in an inclusive democracy and committed to the individual's right to effective life.

261|3|6|"Instrumentarian power cultivates an unusual ""way of knowing"" that combines the ""formal indifference"" of the neoliberal worldview with the observational perspective of radical behaviorism (see [Figure 4](chapter019.xhtml#fig4) [here](chapter019.xhtml#page-396)). Thanks to Big Other's capabilities, instrumentarian power reduces human experience to measurable observable behavior while remaining steadfastly []indifferent to the meaning of that experience. I call this new way of knowing *radical indifference.* It is a form of *observation* *without witness* that yields the obverse of an intimate violent political religion and bears an utterly different signature of havoc: the remote and abstracted contempt of impenetrably complex systems and the interests that author them, carrying individuals on a fast-moving current to the fulfillment of others' ends. What passes for social relations and economic exchange now occurs across the medium of this robotized veil of abstraction."|Chap 3, Para 6|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
262|3|7|"Instrumentarianism's radical indifference is operationalized in Big Other's dehumanized methods of evaluation that produce *equivalence without equality.* These methods reduce individuals to the lowest common denominator of sameness---an organism among organisms---despite all the vital ways in which we are not the same. From Big Other's point of view we are strictly Other-Ones: *organisms that behave.* Big Other encodes the viewpoint of the Other-One as a global presence. There is no brother here of any kind, big or little, evil or good; there are no family ties, however grim. There is no relationship between Big Other and its otherized objects, just as there was no relationship between B. F. Skinner's ""scientists and subjects."" There is no domination of the soul that displaces all intimacy and attachment with terror---far better to let a multitude of relationships bloom. Big Other does not care what we think, feel, or do as long as its millions, billions, and trillions of sensate, actuating, computational eyes and ears can observe, render, datafy, and instrumentalize the vast reservoirs of behavioral surplus that are generated in the galactic uproar of connection and communication."|Chap 3, Para 7|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
263|3|8|"In this new regime, objectification is the moral milieu in which our lives unfold. Although Big Other can mimic intimacy through the tireless devotion of the One Voice---Amazon-Alexa's chirpy service, Google Assistant's reminders and endless information---do not mistake these soothing sounds for anything other than the exploitation of your needs. I think of elephants, that most majestic of all mammals: Big Other poaches our behavior for surplus and leaves behind all the meaning lodged in our bodies, our brains, and our beating hearts, not unlike the monstrous slaughter of elephants for ivory. Forget the cliché that if it's free, ""You are the product."" You are not the product; you are the abandoned carcass. The ""product"" derives from the surplus that is ripped from your life."|Chap 3, Para 8|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
264|3|9|"[]Big Other finally enables the universal technology of behavior that, as Skinner, Stuart MacKay, Mark Weiser, and Joe Paradiso each insisted, accomplishes its aims quietly and persistently, using methods that intentionally bypass our awareness, disappearing into the background of all things. Recall that Alphabet/Google's Eric Schmidt provoked uproar in 2015 when in response to a question on the future of the web, he said, ""The internet will disappear."" What he really meant was that ""The internet will disappear into Big Other."""|Chap 3, Para 9|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
265|3|10|"Thanks to Big Other's capabilities, instrumentarian power aims for a condition of *certainty without terror* in the form of ""guaranteed outcomes."" Because it does not claim our bodies for some grotesque regime of pain and murder, we are prone to undervalue its effects and lower our guard. Instead of death, torture, reeducation, or conversion, instrumentarianism effectively exiles us from our own behavior. It severs our insides from our outsides, our subjectivity and interiority from our observable actions. It lends credibility to the behavioral economists' hypothesis of the frailty of human reason by making it so, as otherized behavior takes on a life of its own that delivers our futures to surveillance capitalism's aims and interests."|Chap 3, Para 10|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
266|3|11|"In an instrumentarian utopia, Big Other simulates the vortex of stimuli, transforming ""natural selection"" into the ""unnatural selection"" of variation and reinforcement authored by market players and the competition for surveillance revenues. We may confuse Big Other with the behaviorist god of the vortex, but only because it effectively conceals the machinations of surveillance capital that are the wizard behind the digital curtain. The seductive voice crafted on the yonder side of this veil---*Google, is that you?*---gently nudges us along the path that coughs up the maximum of behavioral surplus and the closest approximation to certainty. Do not slumber in this opiated fog at the network's edge. That knowing voice is underwritten by the aims and rules of the very place we once hoped to flee, with its commercialized rituals of competition, contempt, and humiliation. Take one wrong step, one deviation from the path of seamless frictionless predictability, and that same voice turns acid in an instant as it instructs ""the vehicular monitoring system not to allow the car to be started."""|Chap 3, Para 11|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
267|3|12|Under the regime of instrumentarian power, the mental agency and self-possession of the right to the future tense are gradually submerged []beneath a new kind of automaticity: a lived experience of stimulus-response-reinforcement aggregated as the comings and goings of mere organisms. Our conformity is irrelevant to instrumentarianism's success. There is no need for mass submission to social norms, no loss of self to the collective induced by terror and compulsion, no offers of acceptance and belonging as a reward for bending to the group. All of that is superseded by a digital order that thrives within things and bodies, transforming volition into reinforcement and action into conditioned response.|Chap 3, Para 12|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
268|3|13|In this way instrumentarian power produces endlessly accruing knowledge for surveillance capitalists and endlessly diminishing freedom for us as it continuously renews surveillance capitalism's domination of the division of learning in society. False consciousness is no longer produced by the hidden facts of class and their relation to production but rather by the hidden facts of instrumentarian power's command over the division of learning in society as it usurps the rights to answer the essential questions: *Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?* Power was once identified with the ownership of the means of production, but it is now identified with ownership of the means of behavioral modification that is Big Other.|Chap 3, Para 13|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
269|3|14|"Big Other and the instrumentarian power that it enables fulfill Skinner's vision for humankind. As early as 1948 in *Walden Two,* Skinner had pined for the new measurement and computational capabilities that would unlock the mysteries of the vortex of stimuli and illuminate those acts of ignorance that we foolishly value as free will. ""I didn't say that behavior is always predictable, any more than the weather is always predictable,"" says Frazier, *Walden Two*'s protagonist. ""There are often too many factors to be taken into account. We can't measure them all accurately, and we couldn't perform the mathematical operations needed to make a prediction if we had the measurements."""|Chap 3, Para 14|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
270|3|15|It was Skinner's hard destiny to foresee the possibility of instrumentarian power and its operationalization in Big Other before the instruments existed to fulfill that vision. His lab had always been a fantasy world of engineering []innovations for his behavioral experiments: mazes and boxes for animal conditioning, measurement tools, and recording devices. A fully operational technology of behavior was the prize that would elude Skinner in his lifetime, a source of frustration that was palpable in every article and lecture right to the end.|Chap 3, Para 15|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
271|3|16|Though confident that science would eventually overcome the practical challenges of a behavioral technology, Skinner was more troubled by the cultural impediments to a human science of behavioral prediction and control founded on the viewpoint of the Other-One. He resented the friction produced by human beings in their stubborn attachment to the values and ideals of freedom inherited from the eighteenth-century philosophers, and he equally despised the existential project of the postwar philosophies that planted authenticity, free will, and autonomous action at the heart of second-modernity yearning.|Chap 3, Para 16|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
272|3|17|"In his penultimate essay, written in 1990, barely three years before his death, Skinner mourned the prospects of behavioral prediction as the foundation of a new society built on scientific certainty: ""To say that a person is simply a place in which something happens seems even more threatening when it raises questions about what we are likely to do rather than what we have done."" In those last years he seemed more resigned to the tenacity of human friction and its stubborn allegiance to something like free will, his voice less outrageous and aggressive than the author of *Beyond Freedom & Dignity,* two decades earlier. Anger and contempt had shaded into weariness and despair with his final reflections:"|Chap 3, Para 17|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
273|3|18|:::  It may be said that this is a discouraging view of human behavior and that we shall be more likely to do something about the future if we continue to believe that our destiny is in our hands. That belief has survived for many centuries and has led to remarkable achievements, but the achievements were only the immediate consequences of what was done. We now know that other consequences have followed and that they are threatening our future. What we have done with our destiny may not be a testament we wish to leave to the world. :::|Chap 3, Para 18|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
274|3|19|In our time of surveillance exceptionalism, as astonishment succumbs to helplessness and resignation, the resistance that Skinner lamented appears to []be waning. The belief that we can choose our destiny is under siege, and, in a dramatic reversal, the dream of a technology of behavioral prediction and control---for which Skinner had endured such public scorn---is now a flourishing fact. This prize now attracts immense capital, human genius, scientific elaboration, governmental protection, ecosystems of institutionalization, and the glamour that always has and always will attach to power.|Chap 3, Para 19|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
275|3|20|"The rise of instrumentarianism follows the path of ""illuminating events"" that, as Hannah Arendt writes, reveal ""a beginning in the past which had hitherto been hidden."" It is in the nature of instrumentarian power to operate remotely and move in stealth. It does not grow through terror, murder, the suspension of democratic institutions, massacre, or expulsion. Instead, it grows through declaration, self-authorization, rhetorical misdirection, euphemism, and the quiet, audacious backstage moves specifically crafted to elude awareness as it replaces individual freedom with others' knowledge and replaces society with certainty. It does not confront democracy but rather erodes it from within, eating away at the human capabilities and self-understanding required to sustain a democratic life."|Chap 3, Para 20|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
276|3|21|The narratives of Facebook's experimental maneuvers, Pokémon Go's prototype of a behavioral-futures-market--dominated society, and the endless examples of digital innovation crushed under the heel of the surveillance creed may be as close as we get to a public announcement of history-illuminating change that moves through us and among us, irreversibly altering life as we have known it. There is no violence here, only the steady displacement of the will to will that has been embodied in self-determination, expressed in the first-person voice, and nourished in the kind of sanctuary that depends upon the possibility of private life and the promise of public freedom.|Chap 3, Para 21|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
277|3|22|Instrumentarian power, like Goethe's Faust, is morally agnostic. The only moral imperative here is distilled from the point of view of a thin utopian gruel. If there is sin, it is the sin of autonomy: the audacity to reject the flows that herd us all toward predictability. Friction is the only evil. Obstruction in law, action, or rhetoric is simply reactionary. The norm is submission to the supposed iron laws of technological inevitability that brook no impediment. It is deemed only rational to surrender and rejoice in new conveniences and harmonies, to wrap ourselves in the first text and embrace a violent ignorance of its shadow.|Chap 3, Para 22|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
278|3|23|[]Totalitarianism was a transformation of the state into a project of total possession. Instrumentarianism and Big Other signal the transformation of the market into a project of total certainty, an undertaking that is unimaginable outside the digital milieu, but also unimaginable outside the logic of accumulation that is surveillance capitalism. This new power is the spawn of an unprecedented convergence: the surveillance and actuation capabilities of Big Other in combination with the discovery and monetization of behavioral surplus. It is only in the context of this convergence that we can imagine economic principles that instrumentalize and control human experience to systematically and predictably shape behavior toward others' profitable ends.|Chap 3, Para 23|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
279|3|24|"Instrumentarian power operates from the vantage point of the Other-One to reduce human persons to the mere animal condition of behavior shorn of reflective meaning. It sees only organisms bent to serve the new laws of capital now imposed on all behavior. Arendt anticipated the destructive potential of behaviorism decades ago when she lamented the devolution of our conception of ""thought"" to something that is accomplished by a ""brain"" and is therefore transferable to ""electronic instruments"":"|Chap 3, Para 24|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE

281|3|26|The trouble with modern theories of behaviorism is not that they are wrong but that they could become true, that they actually are the best possible conceptualization of certain obvious trends in modern society.

282|3|27|Is this to be our home: the automation of the self as the necessary condition of the automation of society, and all for the sake of others' guaranteed outcomes?|Chap 3, Para 27|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
283|3|28|"One place to begin our reckoning with this question is in Arendt's ""Concluding Remarks"" in the first edition of *The Origins of Totalitarianism,* words that have haunted me since I first read them many years ago. They were written at a time when totalitarianism had been defeated in Europe but remained unchallenged in Stalin's USSR. It was a time when much of the world was united in the urgency of understanding and remembering, not only as testament but also as a vaccine against future terror."|Chap 3, Para 28|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
284|3|29|"Arendt's reflections summarize not only totalitarianism's ""futility"" and ""ludicrousness"" but also her sense of the ""disturbing relevance of totalitarian regimes."" She warned that totalitarianism could not be written off as an accidental turn toward tragedy but rather that it must be seen as ""deeply connected with the crisis of this century."" She concluded, ""The fact is that the true problems of our time cannot be understood, let alone solved, without acknowledgement that totalitarianism became this century's curse only because it so terrifyingly took care of its problems."""|Chap 3, Para 29|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
285|3|30|"Now imagine, decades hence, another thinker meditating on the ""disturbing relevance"" of instrumentarian power, observing that ""the true problems of our time cannot be understood, let alone solved, without acknowledgement that instrumentarianism became this century's curse only because it so terrifyingly took care of its problems."""|Chap 3, Para 30|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
286|3|31|"What problems? I have argued that surveillance capitalism and its instrumentarian power feed on the volatile ""conditions of existence"" that I summarize as the ""collision."" Surveillance capitalism offers solutions to individuals in the form of social connection, access to information, time-saving convenience, and, too often, the illusion of support. These are the resources of the first text. More significantly, it offers solutions to institutions in the form of omniscience, control, and certainty. The idea here is not to heal instability---the corrosion of social trust and its broken bonds of reciprocity, dangerous extremes of inequality, regimes of exclusion---but rather to exploit the vulnerabilities produced by these conditions."|Chap 3, Para 31|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
287|3|32|"It is useful to note that despite the much-touted social advantages of always-on connection, social trust in the US declined precipitously during the same period that surveillance capitalism flourished. According to the US []General Social Survey's continuous measurement of ""interpersonal trust attitudes,"" the percentage of Americans who ""think that most people can be trusted"" remained relatively steady between 1972 and 1985. Despite some fluctuations, 46 percent of Americans registered high levels of interpersonal trust in 1972 and nearly 50 percent in 1985. As the neoliberal disciplines began to bite, that percentage steadily declined to 34 percent in 1995, just as the public internet went live. The late 1990s through 2014 saw another period of steady and decisive decline to only 30 percent."|Chap 3, Para 32|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
288|3|33|Societies that display low levels of interpersonal trust also tend to display low levels of trust toward legitimate authority; indeed, levels of trust toward the government have also declined substantially in the US, especially during the decade and a half of growing connectivity and the spread of surveillance capitalism. More than 75 percent of Americans said that they trusted the government most or all of the time in 1958, about 45 percent in 1985, close to 20 percent in 2015, and down to 18 percent in 2017. Social trust is highly correlated with peaceful collective decision making and civic engagement. In its absence, the authority of shared values and mutual obligations slips away. The void that remains is a loud signal of societal vulnerability. Confusion, uncertainty, and distrust enable power to fill the social void. Indeed, they welcome it.|Chap 3, Para 33|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
289|3|34|In the age of surveillance capitalism it is instrumentarian power that fills the void, substituting machines for social relations, which amounts to *the substitution of certainty for society.* In this imagined collective life, freedom is forfeit to others' knowledge, an achievement that is only possible with the resources of the shadow text.|Chap 3, Para 34|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
290|3|35|"The private institutions of capital led the way in this ambitious reformation of collective life and individual experience, but they found necessary support from public institutions, especially as the declaration of a ""war on terror"" legitimated every inclination to enshrine machine-produced certainty as the ultimate solution to societal uncertainty. These mutual affinities assured that instrumentarian power would not be a stepchild but rather an equal partner or even, with increasing regularity, the lord and master upon whom the state depends in its quest for ""total awareness."""|Chap 3, Para 35|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
291|3|36|That instrumentarian power is regarded as the certain solution to uncertain societal conditions is evident in the ways in which it is called into action by the state. The varied and complex institutional patterns produced by these []interactions are a crucial frontier for study and democratic debate. My aim right now is simply to point out a few examples that illustrate the state's continuous demands for the intensification of surveillance capitalism's production of instrumentarian power---expressed in the growth and elaboration of Big Other---as the preferred solution to social breakdown, mistrust, and uncertainty. Although we have become desensitized to a seemingly endless train of such examples, it is important to recognize that in these entanglements, state and market institutions demonstrate a shared commitment to a relentless drive toward guaranteed outcomes. Their mutual affinities can help us define the problem that threatens to make instrumentarian power our century's curse.|Chap 3, Para 36|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
292|3|37|Unsurprisingly, instrumentarian power is consistently called into action as a solution, if not *the* solution, to the threat of terrorism. Acts of terror reject the authority of civilizational norms and reveal the impossibility of society without mutual trust. Governments now turn to instrumentarian power as the solution to this new source of societal uncertainty, demanding the certainty machines that promise direct, reliable means of detection, prediction, and even the automatic actuation of countermeasures.|Chap 3, Para 37|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE

294|3|39|This status quo was interrupted in 2013, when Edward Snowden revealed the hidden complicity between state security agencies and the tech companies. In the backlash that followed, surveillance capitalists confronted new public relations challenges in what they portrayed as an uneasy or even unwilling alliance between private power and state security needs. Nevertheless, new terrorist threats invariably orient public officials toward the intensification and deployment of Big Other and the instrumentarian power it signifies. However, their ability to access this immense power is fraught with tension. It is not simply theirs to command. They must work, at least in part, through the surveillance capitalists.|Chap 3, Para 39|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
295|3|40|"[]For example, in the aftermath of the December 2015 terror attacks in Paris, President Obama, US legislators, and public officials around the world exhorted the tech companies, especially Google, Facebook, and Twitter, to identify and remove terrorist content. The companies were reportedly reluctant to be, or at least to be perceived as, ""tools of government."" Journalists noted that public officials developed ""workarounds"" aimed at achieving access to instrumentarian power without imposing new burdens on the companies' public standing. For example, a government agency could assert that offending online content violates the internet company's terms of service, thus initiating the quick removal of offending material ""without the paper trail that would go with a court order."" Similarly, Google expanded its ""trusted flagger"" program, through which officials and others could identify problematic content for immediate action."|Chap 3, Para 40|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
296|3|41|"The companies responded with their own initiatives. Eric Schmidt suggested new instruments, including a ""spell check for hate,"" to target and eliminate terrorist accounts, remove content before it spreads, and accelerate the dissemination of counter-messages. Top Obama administration officials endorsed that prospect on a pilgrimage to Silicon Valley in January 2016 for a ""terror summit"" with tech leaders. The agenda included discussions on how to disrupt terror activities on the internet, amplify alternative content, disrupt paths to radicalization, and enable security agencies to prevent attacks. A White House briefing memo encouraged the companies to develop a ""radicalism algorithm"" that would digest social media and other sources of surplus to produce something comparable to a credit score, but aimed at evaluating the ""radicalness"" of online content."|Chap 3, Para 41|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
297|3|42|"The turn to instrumentarian power as the solution to uncertainty is not restricted to the US government. Terrorism triggers similar responses in Germany, France, the UK, and around the world. After the 2016 attack on a Berlin Christmas market, German officials announced plans to require suspected extremists to wear electronic tags for perpetual tracking. In 2017 surveillance capitalists, including Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and Twitter, established the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. The objective was to tighten the net of instrumentarian power through ""collaboration on engineering solutions to the problem of sharing content classification techniques,"" ""counterspeech initiatives,"" and a shared database of ""unique digital []fingerprints"" for violent terrorist imagery to accelerate the identification of terrorist accounts. The 2017 joint report of five countries---Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States---included four key commitments, the very first of which was engagement with the internet companies to address online terrorism activities and to support the industry forum led by Google and Facebook. That year, the European Council announced its expectation that ""industry"" would live up to its responsibility ""to develop new technology and tools to improve the automatic detection and removal of content that incites to terrorist acts."" Meeting in Hamburg in 2017, the G20 countries vowed to work with the internet companies, insisting on the need for better instruments to filter, detect, and remove content, and ""encouraging"" the industry to invest in the technology and human capital able to detect and eliminate terrorist activity online."|Chap 3, Para 42|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
298|3|43|"There are other emerging configurations of instrumentarian and state power. For example, former US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Congress in 2016 that the intelligence services might use the ""internet of things"" for ""identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials."" Indeed, a research report from Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society concluded that surveillance capitalism's wave of ""smart"" appliances and products, networked sensors, and the ""internet of things"" would open up ""numerous avenues for government actors to demand access to real-time and recorded communications."""|Chap 3, Para 43|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
299|3|44|"That ""smart"" and ""connected"" signal new channels for commercial *and* government surveillance is neither conjecture nor limited to federal intelligence agencies.

In 2014 data from a Fitbit wristband were used in a personal injury case, and in 2017 police used data from a pacemaker to charge a man with arson and insurance fraud."|Chap 3, Para 44|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
300|3|45|"In the US, local law enforcement has joined the queue of institutions seeking access to instrumentarian power. Surveillance-as-a-service companies eagerly sell their wares to local police departments also determined to find a shortcut to certainty. One startup, Geofeedia, specializes in detailed location tracking of activists and protesters, such as Greenpeace members []or union organizers, and the computation of individualized ""threat scores"" using data drawn from social media. Law-enforcement agencies have been among Geofeedia's most prominent clients. When the Boston Police Department announced its interest in joining this roster in 2016, the city's police commissioner described to the *Boston Globe* his belief in machine certainty as the antidote to social breakdown: ""The attack... on the Ohio State University campus is just the latest illustration of why local law-enforcement authorities need every tool they can muster to stop terrorism and other violence before it starts."" An ACLU attorney countered that the government is using tech companies ""to build massive dossiers on people"" based on nothing more than their constitutionally protected speech. Another, more prominent surveillance-as-a-service company, Palantir, once touted by *Bloomberg Businessweek* as ""the war on terror's secret weapon,"" was found to be in a secret collaboration with the New Orleans Police Department to test its ""predictive policing"" technology.

The aim is ""to leverage the explosion of personal data... in order to improve citizens' behavior.... Individuals and enterprises are to be scored on various aspects of their conduct---where you go, what you buy and who you know---and these scores will be integrated within a comprehensive database that not only links into government information, but also to data collected by private businesses."""|Chap 3, Para 46|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE

The accounts of its pilot programs describe powerful examples of surveillance capitalism's economies of action and the intricate construction of superscale means of behavior modification. The aim is the automation of society through tuning, herding, and conditioning people to produce preselected behaviors judged as desirable by the state and thus able to ""preempt instability,"" as one strategic studies expert put it. In other words, the aim is to achieve guaranteed *social* rather than *market* outcomes using instrumentarian means of behavioral modification.

304|3|49|"China's vision is intended as the solution to its own unique version of the curse of social dissolution. Writing in *Foreign Policy,* journalist Amy Hawkins explains that China's pandemic of social distrust is the problem to which the social credit system is addressed as the cure: ""To be Chinese today is to live in a society of distrust, where every opportunity is a potential con and every act of generosity a risk of exploitation."" A fascinating empirical study of social trust in contemporary China actually finds high levels of ""in-group"" trust but discovers that these are correlated with negative health outcomes. The conclusion is that many Chinese trust only the people who are well-known to them. All other relationships are regarded with suspicion and anxiety, with obvious consequences for social trust as well as well-being. This rampant distrust, typically assigned to the traumas of rapid modernization and the shift to a quasi-capitalist economy, is also the legacy of Chinese totalitarianism. The Chinese Communist Party dismantled traditional domains of affiliation, identity, and social meaning---family, religion, civil society, intellectual discourse, political freedom---recalling Arendt's description of the ""atomization"" that destroys bonds of trust. As Hawkins writes, ""But rather than promoting the organic return of traditional morality to reduce the gulf of distrust, the Chinese government has preferred to invest its energy in []technological fixes... and it's being welcomed by a public fed up of not knowing who to trust... in part because there's no alternative.""

If the defaulter is a company, it may not issue shares or bonds, accept foreign investment or work on government projects. :::|Chap 3, Para 54|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE
310|3|55|"According to a report in *China Daily,* debtors on the list were automatically prevented from flying 6.15 million times since the blacklist was launched in 2013. Those in contempt of court were denied sales of high-speed train tickets 2.22 million times. Some 71,000 defaulters have missed out on executive positions at enterprises as a result of their debts. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China said it had refused loans worth more than 6.97 billion yuan (\$1.01 billion) to debtors on the list. No one is sent to a reeducation camp, but they may not be allowed to purchase luxury goods. According to the director of the Institute of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, ""Given this inconvenience, 10 percent of people on the list started to pay back the money they owed spontaneously.

So far the project is fragmented across many pilots, not only in the tech companies but also in cities and regions, so there is no real test of the scale that the government envisions.

To state the obvious, China is not a democracy and its culture differs profoundly from Western culture. Syracuse University researcher Yang Wang observes that Chinese culture places less value on privacy than does Western culture and that most Chinese have accommodated to the certain knowledge of online government surveillance and censorship. The most common word for privacy, *yinsi,* didn't even appear in popular Chinese dictionaries until the mid-1990s. Chinese citizens have accepted national ID cards with biometric chips, ""birth permits,"" and now social credit rankings because their society has been saturated with surveillance and profiling for decades. For example, the ""dang'an"" is a wide-ranging personal dossier compiled on hundreds of millions of urban residents from childhood and maintained throughout life. This ""Mao-era system for recording the most intimate details of life"" is updated by teachers, Communist Party officials, and employers. Citizens have no rights to see its contents, let alone contest them."|Chap 3, Para 58|03 THE MOAT AROUND THE CASTLE

There are structural differences. In the West, as we have seen, the patterns have taken on many forms. The state began as bosom and shelter, then eager student and envious cousin. Surveillance capitalism and its instruments have come of age now, producing a fitful but necessary partnership.

The state will assume the role of the behaviorist god, owning the shadow text and determining the schedule of reinforcements and the behavioral routines that it will shape.

Within a day he dropped anchor off the coast of a larger island known to its people as Quisqueya or Bohio, setting into motion what historians call the ""conquest pattern."" It's a design that unfolds in three phases: the invention of legalistic measures to provide the invasion with a gloss of justification, a declaration of territorial claims, and the founding of a town to legitimate and institutionalize the conquest.

Without saying anything, he has declared that the bowls are not the same: one bowl is my friend's, and the other bowl is mine. We strengthen the facts of his declaration when I take soup only from ""my"" bowl and my friend takes soup from his. When ""his"" bowl is empty, my friend is still hungry, and he asks permission to take a spoonful of soup from the bowl in front of me, further establishing the fact that it is *my* bowl of soup.

They developed measures intended to impart ""a legalistic veneer by citing and following approved precedents."" To this end the soldiers were tasked with reading the Monarchical Edict of 1513 known as the *Requirimiento* to indigenous villagers before attacking them. The edict declared that the authority of God, the pope, and the king was embodied in the conquistadors and then declared the native peoples as vassals subordinate to that authority: ""You Cacics and Indians of this Continent....

The exercise was so cynical and cruel that the approaching invaders often dispatched their obligation by mumbling the edict's long paragraphs into their beards in the dead of night as they hid among the thick vegetation waiting to pounce: ""Once the Europeans had discharged their duty to inform, the way was clear for pillage and enslavement."" The friar Bartolomé de las Casas, whose account bears witness to this history of Spanish atrocities, wrote that the *Requirimiento* promised the native people fair treatment upon surrender but also spelled out the consequences of defiance. Every act of indigenous resistance was framed as ""revolt,"" thereby legitimizing brutal ""retaliation"" that exceeded military norms, including grotesque torture, the burning of whole villages in the dark of night, and hanging women in public view: ""I will do to you all the evil and damages that a lord may do to vassals who do not obey or receive him.

Adam Smith memorably wrote about this new []principle of industrial organization in his description of a pin factory, and the division of labor remained a topic of economic discourse and controversy throughout the nineteenth century.

Instead, it had burst through those factory walls to becoming the critical organizing principle of industrial *society*. This is also an example of Edison's insight: that the principles of capitalism initially aimed at production eventually shape the wider social and moral milieu.

356|4|32|Economic imperatives predictably mandated the division of labor in production, but what was the purpose of the division of labor in society? This was the question that motivated Durkheim's analysis, and his century-old conclusions are still relevant for us now. He argued that the division of labor accounts for the interdependencies and reciprocities that link the many diverse members of a modern industrial society in a larger prospect of solidarity. Reciprocities breed mutual need, engagement, and respect, all of which imbue this new ordering principle with moral force.|Chap 4, Para 32|04 THE ELABORATION OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM: KIDNAP, CORNER, COMPETE
357|4|33|"In other words, the division of labor was summoned into society at the beginning of the twentieth century by the rapidly changing circumstances of the first modernity's new individuals, discussed in [Chapter 2](chapter002.xhtml). It was an essential response to their new ""conditions of existence."" As people like my great-grandparents joined the migration to a modern world, the old sources of meaning that had bonded communities across space and time melted away. What would hold society together in the absence of the rules and rituals of clan and kin? Durkheim's answer was the division of labor. People's needs for a coherent new source of meaning and structure were the cause, and the []effect was an ordering principle that enabled and sustained a healthy modern community.

359|4|35|"Durkheim's vision was neither sterile nor naive. He recognized that things can take a dark turn and often do, resulting in what he called an ""abnormal"" (sometimes translated as ""pathological"") division of labor that produces social distance, injustice, and discord in place of reciprocity and interdependency. In this context, Durkheim singled out the destructive effects of social inequality on the division of labor in society, especially what he viewed as the most dangerous form of inequality: *extreme asymmetries of power* that make ""conflict itself impossible"" by ""refusing to admit the right of combat."" Such pathologies can be cured only by a politics that asserts the people's right to contest, confront, and prevail in the face of unequal and illegitimate power over society. In the late nineteenth century and most of the twentieth century, that contest was led by labor and other social movements that asserted social equality through institutions such as collective bargaining and public education."|Chap 4, Para 35|04 THE ELABORATION OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM: KIDNAP, CORNER, COMPETE

The specific mechanisms of surveillance capitalism compel the production of two ""electronic texts,"" not just one. When it comes to the first text, we are its authors and readers. This public-facing text is familiar and celebrated for the universe of information and connection it brings to our fingertips. Google Search codifies the informational content of the world wide web. Facebook's News Feed binds the network. Much of this public-facing text is composed of what we inscribe on its pages: our posts, blogs, videos, photos, conversations, music, stories, observations, ""likes,"" tweets, and all the great massing hubbub of our lives captured and communicated."|Chap 4, Para 38|04 THE ELABORATION OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM: KIDNAP, CORNER, COMPETE
363|4|39|"Under the regime of surveillance capitalism, however, the first text does not stand alone; it trails a shadow close behind.

Everything that we contribute to the first text, no matter how trivial or fleeting, becomes a target for surplus extraction. That surplus fills the pages of the second text. This one is hidden from our view: ""read only"" for surveillance capitalists. In this text our experience is dragooned as raw material to be accumulated and analyzed as means to others' market ends. The shadow text is a burgeoning accumulation of behavioral surplus and its analyses, and it says more about us than we can know about ourselves. Worse still, it becomes increasingly difficult, and perhaps impossible, to refrain from contributing to the shadow text.

For now I'll simply point out that Google's algorithms, derived from surplus, select and order search results, and Facebook's algorithms, derived from surplus, select and order the content of its News Feed. In both cases, researchers have shown that these []manipulations reflect each corporation's commercial objectives. As legal scholar Frank Pasquale describes it, ""The decisions at the Googleplex are made behind closed doors... the power to include, exclude, and rank is the power to ensure which public impressions become permanent and which remain fleeting.... Despite their claims of objectivity and neutrality, they are constantly making value-laden, controversial decisions. They help create the world they claim to merely 'show' us."" When it comes to the shadow text, surveillance capitalism's laws of motion compel both its secrecy and its continuous growth. We are the objects of its narratives, from whose lessons we are excluded. As the source from which all the treasure flows, this second text is *about* us, but it is not *for* us.

365|4|41|The result is that the division of learning is both the ascendant principle of social ordering in our information civilization and already a hostage to surveillance capitalism's privileged position as the dominant composer, owner, and guardian of the texts. Surveillance capitalism's ability to corrupt and control these texts produces unprecedented asymmetries of knowledge and power that operate precisely as Durkheim had feared: the relatively free rein accorded to this market form and the innately illegible character of its action have enabled it to impose substantial control over the division of learning outside of our awareness and without means of combat. When it comes to the essential questions, surveillance capital has gathered the power and asserted the authority to supply all the answers. However, even authority is not enough.

Facebook, Amazon, and Google have promised to... create value out of vast amounts of data through intelligent computational analysis."" The rise of surveillance capitalism necessarily turns Hilbert's advice into a dangerous proposition.

Google is the pioneer of ""hyperscale,"" considered to be ""the largest computer network on Earth."" Hyperscale operations are found in high-volume information businesses such as telecoms and global payments firms, where data centers require millions of ""virtual servers"" that exponentially increase computing capabilities without requiring substantial expansion of physical space, cooling, or electrical power demands.

By 2013, the company understood that its shift into the ""neural []networks"" that define the current frontier of artificial intelligence would substantially increase computational demands and require a doubling of its data centers. As Urs Hölzle, Google's senior vice president of technical infrastructure, put it, ""The dirty secret behind \[AI\] is that they require an insane number of computations to just actually train the network.""

Information processing is developing, therefore, into an essential element of long-term strategies of manipulation intended to mold and adjust individual conduct.""

It is the systematic result of a ""pathological"" division of learning in society in which surveillance capitalism knows, decides, and decides who decides. Demanding privacy from surveillance capitalists or lobbying for an end to commercial surveillance on the internet is like asking Henry Ford to make each Model T by hand or asking a giraffe to shorten its neck.

Surveillance capitalism rose to dominance in the US under conditions of relative lawlessness. From there it spread to Europe, and it continues to make inroads in every region of the world.

398|5|9|[]It is in the nature of human attachment that every journey and expulsion sets into motion the search for home. That *nostos,* finding home, is among our most profound needs is evident by the price we are willing to pay for it. There is a universally shared ache to return to the place we left behind or to found a new home in which our hopes for the future can nest and grow. We still recount the travails of Odysseus and recall what human beings will endure for the sake of reaching our own shores and entering our own gates.|Chap 5, Para 9|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
399|5|10|Because our brains are larger than those of birds and sea turtles, we know that it is not always possible, or even desirable, to return to the same patch of earth. Home need not always correspond to a single dwelling or place. We can choose its form and location but not its meaning. Home is where we know and where we are known, where we love and are beloved. Home is mastery, voice, relationship, and sanctuary: part freedom, part flourishing... part refuge, part prospect.|Chap 5, Para 10|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
400|5|11|The sense of home slipping away provokes an unbearable yearning. The Portuguese have a name for this feeling: *saudade,* a word said to capture the homesickness and longing of separation from the homeland among emigrants across the centuries. Now the disruptions of the twenty-first century have turned these exquisite anxieties and longings of dislocation into a universal story that engulfs each one of us.|Chap 5, Para 11|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
401|5|12|"In 2000 a group of computer scientists and engineers at Georgia Tech collaborated on a project called the ""Aware Home."" It was meant to be a ""living laboratory"" for the study of ""ubiquitous computing."" They imagined a ""human-home symbiosis"" in which many animate and inanimate processes would be captured by an elaborate network of ""context aware sensors"" embedded in the house and by wearable computers worn by the home's occupants. The design called for an ""automated wireless collaboration"" between the platform that hosted personal information from the occupants' wearables and a second one that hosted the environmental information from the sensors."|Chap 5, Para 12|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
402|5|13|"[]There were three working assumptions: first, the scientists and engineers understood that the new data systems would produce an entirely new knowledge domain. Second, it was assumed that the rights to that new knowledge and the power to use it to improve one's life would belong exclusively to the people who live in the house. Third, the team assumed that for all of its digital wizardry, the Aware Home would take its place as a modern incarnation of the ancient conventions that understand ""home"" as the private sanctuary of those who dwell within its walls."|Chap 5, Para 13|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
403|5|14|"All of this was expressed in the engineering plan. It emphasized trust, simplicity, the sovereignty of the individual, and the inviolability of the home as a private domain. The Aware Home information system was imagined as a simple ""closed loop"" with only two nodes and controlled entirely by the home's occupants. Because the house would be ""constantly monitoring the occupants' whereabouts and activities... even tracing its inhabitants' medical conditions,"" the team concluded, ""there is a clear need to give the occupants knowledge and control of the distribution of this information."" All the information was to be stored on the occupants' wearable computers ""to insure the privacy of an individual's information."""|Chap 5, Para 14|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
404|5|15|"By 2018, the global ""smart-home"" market was valued at \$36 billion and expected to reach \$151 billion by 2023. The numbers betray an earthquake beneath their surface. Consider just one smart-home device: the Nest thermostat, which was made by a company that was owned by Alphabet, the Google holding company, and then merged with Google in 2018. The Nest thermostat does many things imagined in the Aware Home. It collects data about its uses and environment. It uses motion sensors and computation to ""learn"" the behaviors of a home's inhabitants. Nest's apps can gather data from other connected products such as cars, ovens, fitness trackers, and beds. Such systems can, for example, trigger lights if an anomalous motion is detected, signal video and audio recording, and even send notifications to homeowners or others. As a result of the merger with Google, the thermostat, like other Nest products, will be built with Google's artificial intelligence capabilities, including its personal digital ""assistant."" Like the Aware Home, the thermostat and its brethren devices create immense new stores of knowledge and therefore new power---but for whom?"|Chap 5, Para 15|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
405|5|16|"[]Wi-Fi--enabled and networked, the thermostat's intricate, personalized data stores are uploaded to Google's servers. Each thermostat comes with a ""privacy policy,"" a ""terms-of-service agreement,"" and an ""end-user licensing agreement."" These reveal oppressive privacy and security consequences in which sensitive household and personal information are shared with other smart devices, unnamed personnel, and third parties for the purposes of predictive analyses and sales to other unspecified parties. Nest takes little responsibility for the security of the information it collects and none for how the other companies in its ecosystem will put those data to use. A detailed analysis of Nest's policies by two University of London scholars concluded that were one to enter into the Nest ecosystem of connected devices and apps, each with their own equally burdensome and audacious terms, the purchase of a single home thermostat would entail the need to review nearly a thousand so-called contracts."|Chap 5, Para 16|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
406|5|17|Should the customer refuse to agree to Nest's stipulations, the terms of service indicate that the functionality and security of the thermostat will be deeply compromised, no longer supported by the necessary updates meant to ensure its reliability and safety. The consequences can range from frozen pipes to failed smoke alarms to an easily hacked internal home system.|Chap 5, Para 17|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
407|5|18|By 2018, the assumptions of the Aware Home were gone with the wind. Where did they go? What was that wind? The Aware Home, like many other visionary projects, imagined a digital future that empowers individuals to lead more-effective lives. What is most critical is that in the year 2000 this vision naturally assumed an unwavering commitment to the privacy of individual experience. Should an individual choose to render her experience digitally, then she would exercise exclusive rights to the knowledge garnered from such data, as well as exclusive rights to decide how such knowledge might be put to use. Today these rights to privacy, knowledge, and application have been usurped by a bold market venture powered by unilateral claims to others' experience and the knowledge that flows from it. What does this sea change mean for us, for our children, for our democracies, and for the very possibility of a human future in a digital world? This book aims to answer these questions. It is about the darkening of the digital dream and its rapid mutation into a voracious and utterly novel commercial project that I call *surveillance capitalism*.|Chap 5, Para 18|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
408|5|19|"Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data are applied to product or service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary *behavioral surplus,* fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as ""machine intelligence,"" and fabricated into *prediction products* that anticipate what you will do now, soon, and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace for behavioral predictions that I call *behavioral futures markets*. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are eager to lay bets on our future behavior."|Chap 5, Para 19|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
409|5|20|"As we shall see in the coming chapters, the competitive dynamics of these new markets drive surveillance capitalists to acquire ever-more-predictive sources of behavioral surplus: our voices, personalities, and emotions. Eventually, surveillance capitalists discovered that the most-predictive behavioral data come from intervening in the state of play in order to nudge, coax, tune, and herd behavior toward profitable outcomes. Competitive pressures produced this shift, in which automated machine processes not only *know* our behavior but also *shape* our behavior at scale. With this reorientation from knowledge to power, it is no longer enough to automate information flow*s* *about us;* the goal now is to *automate us.* In this phase of surveillance capitalism's evolution, the means of production are subordinated to an increasingly complex and comprehensive ""means of behavioral modification."" In this way, surveillance capitalism births a new species of power that I call *instrumentarianism.* Instrumentarian power knows and shapes human behavior toward others' ends. Instead of armaments and armies, it works its will through the automated medium of an increasingly ubiquitous computational architecture of ""smart"" networked devices, things, and spaces."|Chap 5, Para 20|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
410|5|21|"In the coming chapters we will follow the growth and dissemination of these operations and the instrumentarian power that sustains them. Indeed, it has become difficult to escape this bold market project, whose tentacles reach from the gentle herding of innocent Pokémon Go players to eat, drink, and purchase in the restaurants, bars, fast-food joints, and shops that pay to []play in its behavioral futures markets to the ruthless expropriation of surplus from Facebook profiles for the purposes of shaping individual behavior, whether it's buying pimple cream at 5:45 [P.M]. on Friday, clicking ""yes"" on an offer of new running shoes as the endorphins race through your brain after your long Sunday morning run, or voting next week. Just as industrial capitalism was driven to the continuous intensification of the means of production, so surveillance capitalists and their market players are now locked into the continuous intensification of the means of behavioral modification and the gathering might of instrumentarian power."|Chap 5, Para 21|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
411|5|22|"Surveillance capitalism runs contrary to the early digital dream, consigning the Aware Home to ancient history. Instead, it strips away the illusion that the networked form has some kind of indigenous moral content, that being ""connected"" is somehow intrinsically pro-social, innately inclusive, or naturally tending toward the democratization of knowledge. Digital connection is now a means to others' commercial ends. At its core, surveillance capitalism is parasitic and self-referential. It revives Karl Marx's old image of capitalism as a vampire that feeds on labor, but with an unexpected turn. Instead of labor, surveillance capitalism feeds on every aspect of every human's experience."|Chap 5, Para 22|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
412|5|23|Google invented and perfected surveillance capitalism in much the same way that a century ago General Motors invented and perfected managerial capitalism. Google was the pioneer of surveillance capitalism in thought and practice, the deep pocket for research and development, and the trailblazer in experimentation and implementation, but it is no longer the only actor on this path. Surveillance capitalism quickly spread to Facebook and later to Microsoft. Evidence suggests that Amazon has veered in this direction, and it is a constant challenge to Apple, both as an external threat and as a source of internal debate and conflict.|Chap 5, Para 23|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
413|5|24|As the pioneer of surveillance capitalism, Google launched an unprecedented market operation into the unmapped spaces of the internet, where it faced few impediments from law or competitors, like an invasive species in a landscape free of natural predators. Its leaders drove the systemic coherence of their businesses at a breakneck pace that neither public institutions nor individuals could follow. Google also benefited from historical events when a national security apparatus galvanized by the attacks of 9/11 was inclined to []nurture, mimic, shelter, and appropriate surveillance capitalism's emergent capabilities for the sake of total knowledge and its promise of certainty.|Chap 5, Para 24|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
414|5|25|Surveillance capitalists quickly realized that they could do anything they wanted, and they did. They dressed in the fashions of advocacy and emancipation, appealing to and exploiting contemporary anxieties, while the real action was hidden offstage. Theirs was an invisibility cloak woven in equal measure to the rhetoric of the empowering web, the ability to move swiftly, the confidence of vast revenue streams, and the wild, undefended nature of the territory they would conquer and claim. They were protected by the inherent illegibility of the automated processes that they rule, the ignorance that these processes breed, and the sense of inevitability that they foster.|Chap 5, Para 25|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
415|5|26|"Surveillance capitalism is no longer confined to the competitive dramas of the large internet companies, where behavioral futures markets were first aimed at online advertising. Its mechanisms and economic imperatives have become the default model for most internet-based businesses. Eventually, competitive pressure drove expansion into the offline world, where the same foundational mechanisms that expropriate your online browsing, likes, and clicks are trained on your run in the park, breakfast conversation, or hunt for a parking space. Today's prediction products are traded in behavioral futures markets that extend retail, finance, and an ever-widening range of goods and services companies determined to participate in these new and profitable markets. Whether it's a ""smart"" home device, what the insurance companies call ""behavioral underwriting,"" or any one of thousands of other transactions, we now pay for our own domination."|Chap 5, Para 26|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
416|5|27|"Surveillance capitalism's products and services are not the objects of a value exchange. They do not establish constructive producer-consumer reciprocities. Instead, they are the ""hooks"" that lure users into their extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others' ends. We are not surveillance capitalism's ""customers."" Although the saying tells us ""If it's free, then you are the product,"" that is also incorrect. We are the sources of surveillance capitalism's crucial surplus: the objects of a technologically advanced and increasingly inescapable raw-material-extraction operation. Surveillance capitalism's actual customers are the enterprises that trade in its markets for future behavior."|Chap 5, Para 27|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
417|5|28|"[]This logic turns ordinary life into the daily renewal of a twenty-first-century Faustian compact. ""Faustian"" because it is nearly impossible to tear ourselves away, despite the fact that what we must give in return will destroy life as we have known it. Consider that the internet has become essential for social participation, that the internet is now saturated with commerce, and that commerce is now subordinated to surveillance capitalism. Our dependency is at the heart of the commercial surveillance project, in which our felt needs for effective life vie against the inclination to resist its bold incursions. This conflict produces a psychic numbing that inures us to the realities of being tracked, parsed, mined, and modified. It disposes us to rationalize the situation in resigned cynicism, create excuses that operate like defense mechanisms (""I have nothing to hide""), or find other ways to stick our heads in the sand, choosing ignorance out of frustration and helplessness. In this way, surveillance capitalism imposes a fundamentally illegitimate choice that twenty-first-century individuals should not have to make, and its normalization leaves us singing in our chains."|Chap 5, Para 28|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
418|5|29|Surveillance capitalism operates through unprecedented asymmetries in knowledge and the power that accrues to knowledge. Surveillance capitalists know everything *about us,* whereas their operations are designed to be unknowable *to us*. They accumulate vast domains of new knowledge *from* *us,* but not *for* *us.* They predict our futures for the sake of others' gain, not ours. As long as surveillance capitalism and its behavioral futures markets are allowed to thrive, ownership of the new means of behavioral modification eclipses ownership of the means of production as the fountainhead of capitalist wealth and power in the twenty-first century.|Chap 5, Para 29|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
419|5|30|These facts and their consequences for our individual lives, our societies, our democracies, and our emerging information civilization are examined in detail in the coming chapters. The evidence and reasoning employed here suggest that surveillance capitalism is a rogue force driven by novel economic imperatives that disregard social norms and nullify the elemental rights associated with individual autonomy that are essential to the very possibility of a democratic society.|Chap 5, Para 30|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
420|5|31|Just as industrial civilization flourished at the expense of nature and now threatens to cost us the Earth, an information civilization shaped by surveillance capitalism and its new instrumentarian power will thrive at the expense []of human nature and will threaten to cost us our humanity. The industrial legacy of climate chaos fills us with dismay, remorse, and fear. As surveillance capitalism becomes the dominant form of information capitalism in our time, what fresh legacy of damage and regret will be mourned by future generations? By the time you read these words, the reach of this new form will have grown as more sectors, firms, startups, app developers, and investors mobilize around this one plausible version of information capitalism. This mobilization and the resistance it engenders will define a key battleground upon which the possibility of a human future at the new frontier of power will be contested.|Chap 5, Para 31|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
421|5|32|"One explanation for surveillance capitalism's many triumphs floats above them all: it is *unprecedented*. The unprecedented is necessarily unrecognizable. When we encounter something unprecedented, we automatically interpret it through the lenses of familiar categories, thereby rendering invisible precisely that which is unprecedented. A classic example is the notion of the ""horseless carriage"" to which people reverted when confronted with the unprecedented facts of the automobile. A tragic illustration is the encounter between indigenous people and the first Spanish conquerors. When the Taínos of the pre-Columbian Caribbean islands first laid eyes on the sweating, bearded Spanish soldiers trudging across the sand in their brocade and armor, how could they possibly have recognized the meaning and portent of that moment? Unable to imagine their own destruction, they reckoned that those strange creatures were gods and welcomed them with intricate rituals of hospitality. This is how the unprecedented reliably confounds understanding; existing lenses illuminate the familiar, thus obscuring the original by turning the unprecedented into an extension of the past. This contributes to the normalization of the abnormal, which makes fighting the unprecedented even more of an uphill climb."|Chap 5, Para 32|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
422|5|33|On a stormy night some years ago, our home was struck by lightning, and I learned a powerful lesson in the comprehension-defying power of the unprecedented. Within moments of the strike, thick black smoke drifted up the staircase []from the lower level of the house and toward the living room. As we mobilized and called the fire department, I believed that I had just a minute or two to do something useful before rushing out to join my family. First, I ran upstairs and closed all the bedroom doors to protect them from smoke damage. Next, I tore back downstairs to the living room, where I gathered up as many of our family photo albums as I could carry and set them outside on a covered porch for safety. The smoke was just about to reach me when the fire marshal arrived to grab me by the shoulder and yank me out the door. We stood in the driving rain, where, to our astonishment, we watched the house explode in flames.|Chap 5, Para 33|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
423|5|34|I learned many things from the fire, but among the most important was the unrecognizability of the unprecedented. In that early phase of crisis, I could imagine our home scarred by smoke damage, but I could not imagine its disappearance. I grasped what was happening through the lens of past experience, envisioning a distressing but ultimately manageable detour that would lead back to the status quo. Unable to distinguish the unprecedented, all I could do was to close doors to rooms that would no longer exist and seek safety on a porch that was fated to vanish. I was blind to conditions that were unprecedented in my experience.|Chap 5, Para 34|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
424|5|35|I began to study the emergence of what I would eventually call surveillance capitalism in 2006, interviewing entrepreneurs and staff in a range of tech companies in the US and the UK. For several years I thought that the unexpected and disturbing practices that I documented were detours from the main road: management oversights or failures of judgment and contextual understanding.|Chap 5, Para 35|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
425|5|36|My field data were destroyed in the fire that night, and by the time I picked up the thread again early in 2011, it was clear to me that my old horseless-carriage lenses could not explain or excuse what was taking shape. I had lost many details hidden in the brush, but the profiles of the trees stood out more clearly than before: information capitalism had taken a decisive turn toward a new logic of accumulation, with its own original operational mechanisms, economic imperatives, and markets. I could see that this new form had broken away from the norms and practices that define the history of capitalism and in that process something startling and unprecedented had emerged.|Chap 5, Para 36|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
426|5|37|Of course, the emergence of the unprecedented in economic history cannot be compared to a house fire. The portents of a catastrophic fire were []unprecedented in my experience, but they were not original. In contrast, surveillance capitalism is a new actor in history, both original and sui generis. It is of its own kind and unlike anything else: a distinct new planet with its own physics of time and space, its sixty-seven-hour days, emerald sky, inverted mountain ranges, and dry water.|Chap 5, Para 37|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
427|5|38|"Nonetheless, the danger of closing doors to rooms that will no longer exist is very real. The unprecedented nature of surveillance capitalism has enabled it to elude systematic contest because it cannot be adequately grasped with our existing concepts. We rely on categories such as ""monopoly"" or ""privacy"" to contest surveillance capitalist practices. And although these issues are vital, and even when surveillance capitalist operations are also monopolistic and a threat to privacy, the existing categories nevertheless fall short in identifying and contesting the most crucial and unprecedented facts of this new regime."|Chap 5, Para 38|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
428|5|39|Will surveillance capitalism continue on its current trajectory to become the dominant logic of accumulation of our age, or, in the fullness of time, will we judge it to have been a toothed bird: A fearsome but ultimately doomed dead end in capitalism's longer journey? If it is to be doomed, then what will make it so? What will an effective vaccine entail?|Chap 5, Para 39|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
429|5|40|"Every vaccine begins in careful knowledge of the enemy disease. This book is a journey to encounter what is strange, original, and even unimaginable in surveillance capitalism. It is animated by the conviction that fresh observation, analysis, and new naming are required if we are to grasp the unprecedented as a necessary prelude to effective contest. The chapters that follow will examine the specific conditions that allowed surveillance capitalism to root and flourish as well as the ""laws of motion"" that drive the action and expansion of this market form: its foundational mechanisms, economic imperatives, economies of supply, construction of power, and principles of social ordering. Let's close doors, but let's make sure that they are the right ones."|Chap 5, Para 40|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
430|5|41|"Our effort to confront the unprecedented begins with the recognition that *we hunt the puppet master, not the puppet.* A first challenge to comprehension []is the confusion between surveillance capitalism and the technologies it employs. Surveillance capitalism is not technology; it is a logic that imbues technology and commands it into action. Surveillance capitalism is a market form that is unimaginable outside the digital milieu, but it is not the same as the ""digital."" As we saw in the story of the Aware Home, and as we shall see again in [Chapter 2](chapter002.xhtml), the digital can take many forms depending upon the social and economic logics that bring it to life. It is capitalism that assigns the price tag of subjugation and helplessness, not the technology."|Chap 5, Para 41|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
431|5|42|"That surveillance capitalism is a logic in action and not a technology is a vital point because surveillance capitalists want us to think that their practices are inevitable expressions of the technologies they employ. For example, in 2009 the public first became aware that Google maintains our search histories indefinitely: data that are available as raw-material supplies are also available to intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. When questioned about these practices, the corporation's former CEO Eric Schmidt mused, ""The reality is that search engines including Google do retain this information for some time."""|Chap 5, Para 42|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
432|5|43|"In truth, search engines do not retain, but surveillance capitalism does. Schmidt's statement is a classic of misdirection that bewilders the public by conflating commercial imperatives and technological necessity. It camouflages the concrete practices of surveillance capitalism and the specific choices that impel Google's brand of search into action. Most significantly, it makes surveillance capitalism's practices appear to be inevitable when they are actually meticulously calculated and lavishly funded means to self-dealing commercial ends. We will examine this notion of ""inevitabilism"" in depth in [Chapter 7](chapter012.xhtml). For now, suffice to say that despite all the futuristic sophistication of digital innovation, the message of the surveillance capitalist companies barely differs from the themes once glorified in the motto of the 1933 Chicago World's Fair: ""Science Finds---Industry Applies---Man Conforms."""|Chap 5, Para 43|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
433|5|44|"In order to challenge such claims of technological inevitability, we must establish our bearings. We cannot evaluate the current trajectory of information civilization without a clear appreciation that technology is not and never can be a thing in itself, isolated from economics and society. This means that technological inevitability does not exist. Technologies are always economic means, not ends in themselves: in modern times, technology's DNA comes []already patterned by what the sociologist Max Weber called the ""economic orientation."""|Chap 5, Para 44|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
434|5|45|"Economic ends, Weber observed, are always intrinsic to technology's development and deployment. ""Economic action"" determines objectives, whereas technology provides ""appropriate *means.*"" In Weber's framing, ""The fact that what is called the technological development of modern times has been so largely oriented economically to profit-making is one of the fundamental facts of the history of technology."" In a modern capitalist society, technology was, is, and always will be an expression of the economic objectives that direct it into action. A worthwhile exercise would be to delete the word ""technology"" from our vocabularies in order to see how quickly capitalism's objectives are exposed."|Chap 5, Para 45|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
435|5|46|Surveillance capitalism employs many technologies, but it cannot be equated with any technology. Its operations may employ platforms, but these operations are not the same as platforms. It employs machine intelligence, but it cannot be reduced to those machines. It produces and relies on algorithms, but it is not the same as algorithms. Surveillance capitalism's unique economic imperatives are the puppet masters that hide behind the curtain orienting the machines and summoning them to action. These imperatives, to indulge another metaphor, are like the body's soft tissues that cannot be seen in an X-ray but do the real work of binding muscle and bone. We are not alone in falling prey to the technology illusion. It is an enduring theme of social thought, as old as the Trojan horse. Despite this, each generation stumbles into the quicksand of forgetting that technology is an expression of other interests. In modern times this means the interests of capital, and in our time it is surveillance capital that commands the digital milieu and directs our trajectory toward the future. Our aim in this book is to discern the laws of surveillance capitalism that animate today's exotic Trojan horses, returning us to age-old questions as they bear down on our lives, our societies, and our civilization.|Chap 5, Para 46|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
436|5|47|"We have stood at this kind of precipice before. ""We've stumbled along for a while, trying to run a new civilization in old ways, but we've got to start to make this world over."" It was 1912 when Thomas Edison laid out his vision for a new industrial civilization in a letter to Henry Ford. Edison worried that industrialism's potential to serve the progress of humanity would be thwarted []by the stubborn power of the robber barons and the monopolist economics that ruled their kingdoms. He decried the ""wastefulness"" and ""cruelty"" of US capitalism: ""Our production, our factory laws, our charities, our relations between capital and labor, our distribution---all wrong, out of gear."" Both Edison and Ford understood that the modern industrial civilization for which they harbored such hope was careening toward a darkness marked by misery for the many and prosperity for the few."|Chap 5, Para 47|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
437|5|48|Most important for our conversation, Edison and Ford understood that the moral life of industrial civilization would be shaped by the practices of capitalism that rose to dominance in their time. They believed that America, and eventually the world, would have to fashion a new, more rational capitalism in order to avert a future of misery and conflict. Everything, as Edison suggested, would have to be reinvented: new technologies, yes, but these would have to reflect new ways of understanding and fulfilling people's needs; a new economic model that could turn those new practices into profit; and a new social contract that could sustain it all. A new century had dawned, but the evolution of capitalism, like the churning of civilizations, did not obey the calendar or the clock. It was 1912, and still the nineteenth century refused to relinquish its claim on the twentieth.|Chap 5, Para 48|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
438|5|49|The same can be said of our time. As I write these words, we are nearing the end of the second decade of the twenty-first century, but the economic and social contests of the twentieth continue to tear us apart. These contests are the stage upon which surveillance capitalism made its debut and rose to stardom as the author of a new chapter in the long saga of capitalism's evolution. This is the dramatic context to which we will turn in the opening pages of Part I: the place upon which we must stand in order to evaluate our subject in its rightful context. Surveillance capitalism is not an accident of overzealous technologists, but rather a rogue capitalism that learned to cunningly exploit its historical conditions to ensure and defend its success.|Chap 5, Para 49|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
439|5|50|This book is intended as an initial mapping of a terra incognita, a first foray that I hope will pave the way for more explorers. The effort to understand []surveillance capitalism and its consequences has dictated a path of exploration that crosses many disciplines and historical periods. My aim has been to develop the concepts and frameworks that enable us to see the pattern in what have appeared to be disparate concepts, phenomena, and fragments of rhetoric and practice, as each new point on the map contributes to materializing the puppet master in flesh and bone.|Chap 5, Para 50|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
440|5|51|Many of the points on this map are necessarily drawn from fast-moving currents in turbulent times. In making sense of contemporary developments, my method has been to isolate the deeper pattern in the welter of technological detail and corporate rhetoric. The test of my efficacy will be in how well this map and its concepts illuminate the unprecedented and empower us with a more cogent and comprehensive understanding of the rapid flow of events that boil around us as surveillance capitalism pursues its long game of economic and social domination.|Chap 5, Para 51|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
441|5|52|"*The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* has four parts. Each presents four to five chapters as well as a final chapter intended as a coda that reflects on and conceptualizes the meaning of what has gone before. Part I addresses the foundations of surveillance capitalism: its origins and early elaboration. We begin in [Chapter 2](chapter002.xhtml) by setting the stage upon which surveillance capitalism made its debut and achieved success. This stage setting is important because I fear that we have contented ourselves for too long with superficial explanations of the rapid rise and general acceptance of the practices associated with surveillance capitalism. For example, we have credited notions such as ""convenience"" or the fact that many of its services are ""free."" Instead, [Chapter 2](chapter002.xhtml) explores the social conditions that summoned the digital into our everyday lives and enabled surveillance capitalism to root and flourish. I describe the ""collision"" between the centuries-old historical processes of individualization that shape our experience as self-determining individuals and the harsh social habitat produced by a decades-old regime of neoliberal market economics in which our sense of self-worth and needs for self-determination are routinely thwarted. The pain and frustration of this contradiction are the condition that sent us careening toward the internet for sustenance and ultimately bent us to surveillance capitalism's draconian quid pro quo."|Chap 5, Para 52|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
442|5|53|"Part I moves on to a close examination of surveillance capitalism's invention and early elaboration at Google, beginning with the discovery and []early development of what would become its foundational mechanisms, economic imperatives, and ""laws of motion."" For all of Google's technological prowess and computational talent, the real credit for its success goes to the radical social relations that the company declared as facts, beginning with its disregard for the boundaries of private human experience and the moral integrity of the autonomous individual. Instead, surveillance capitalists asserted their right to invade at will, usurping individual decision rights in favor of unilateral surveillance and the self-authorized extraction of human experience for others' profit. These invasive claims were nurtured by the absence of law to impede their progress, the mutuality of interests between the fledgling surveillance capitalists and state intelligence agencies, and the tenacity with which the corporation defended its new territories. Eventually, Google codified a tactical playbook on the strength of which its surveillance capitalist operations were successfully institutionalized as the dominant form of information capitalism, drawing new competitors eager to participate in the race for surveillance revenues. On the strength of these achievements, Google and its expanding universe of competitors enjoy extraordinary new asymmetries of knowledge and power, unprecedented in the human story. I argue that the significance of these developments is best understood as the privatization of the *division of learning in society,* the critical axis of social order in the twenty-first century."|Chap 5, Para 53|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
443|5|54|"Part II traces the migration of surveillance capitalism from the online environment to the real world, a consequence of the competition for prediction products that approximate certainty. Here we explore this new *reality business,* as all aspects of human experience are claimed as raw-material supplies and targeted for rendering into behavioral data. Much of this new work is accomplished under the banner of ""personalization,"" a camouflage for aggressive extraction operations that mine the intimate depths of everyday life. As competition intensifies, surveillance capitalists learn that extracting human experience is not enough. The most-predictive raw-material supplies come from intervening in our experience to shape our behavior in ways that favor surveillance capitalists' commercial outcomes. New automated protocols are designed to influence and modify human behavior at scale as the means of production is subordinated to a new and more complex *means of behavior modification.* We see these new protocols at work in Facebook's contagion []experiments and the Google-incubated augmented reality ""game"" Pokémon Go. The evidence of our psychic numbing is that only a few decades ago US society denounced mass behavior-modification techniques as unacceptable threats to individual autonomy and the democratic order. Today the same practices meet little resistance or even discussion as they are routinely and pervasively deployed in the march toward surveillance revenues. Finally, I consider surveillance capitalism's operations as a challenge to the elemental *right to the future tense,* which accounts for the individual's ability to imagine, intend, promise, and construct a future. It is an essential condition of free will and, more poignantly, of the inner resources from which we draw *the will to will*. I ask and answer the question *How did they get away with it?* Part II ends with a meditation on our once and future history. *If industrial capitalism dangerously disrupted nature, what havoc might surveillance capitalism wreak on human nature?*"|Chap 5, Para 54|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
444|5|55|"Part III examines the rise of instrumentarian power; its expression in a ubiquitous sensate, networked, computational infrastructure that I call *Big Other;* and the novel and deeply antidemocratic vision of society and social relations that these produce. I argue that instrumentarianism is an unprecedented species of power that has defied comprehension in part because it has been subjected to the ""horseless-carriage"" syndrome. Instrumentarian power has been viewed through the old lenses of totalitarianism, obscuring what is different and dangerous. Totalitarianism was a transformation of the state into a project of total possession. Instrumentarianism and its materialization in Big Other signal the transformation of the market into a project of total certainty, an undertaking that is unimaginable outside the digital milieu and the logic of surveillance capitalism. In naming and analyzing instrumentarian power, I explore its intellectual origins in early theoretical physics and its later expression in the work of the radical behaviorist B. F. Skinner."|Chap 5, Para 55|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
445|5|56|"Part III follows surveillance capitalism into a second phase change. The first was the migration from the virtual to the real world. The second is a shift of focus from the real world to the social world, as society itself becomes the new object of extraction and control. Just as industrial society was imagined as a well-functioning machine, instrumentarian society is imagined as a human simulation of machine learning systems: a confluent hive mind in which each element learns and operates in concert with every other element. In the []model of machine confluence, the ""freedom"" of each individual machine is subordinated to the knowledge of the system as a whole. Instrumentarian power aims to organize, herd, and tune society to achieve a similar *social confluence,* in which group pressure and computational certainty replace politics and democracy, extinguishing the felt reality and social function of an individualized existence. The youngest members of our societies already experience many of these destructive dynamics in their attachment to social media, the first global experiment in the human hive. I consider the implications of these developments for a second elemental right: *the* *right to sanctuary*. The human need for a space of inviolable refuge has persisted in civilized societies from ancient times but is now under attack as surveillance capital creates a world of ""no exit"" with profound implications for the human future at this new frontier of power."|Chap 5, Para 56|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
446|5|57|"In the final chapter I conclude that surveillance capitalism departs from the history of market capitalism in surprising ways, demanding both unimpeded freedom *and* total knowledge, abandoning capitalism's reciprocities with people and society, and imposing a totalizing collectivist vision of life in the hive, with surveillance capitalists and their data priesthood in charge of oversight and control. Surveillance capitalism and its rapidly accumulating instrumentarian power exceed the historical norms of capitalist ambitions, claiming dominion over human, societal, and political territories that range far beyond the conventional institutional terrain of the private firm or the market. As a result, surveillance capitalism is best described as a *coup from above,* not an overthrow of the state but rather an overthrow of the people's sovereignty and a prominent force in the perilous drift toward democratic deconsolidation that now threatens Western liberal democracies. Only ""we the people"" can reverse this course, first by naming the unprecedented, then by mobilizing new forms of collaborative action: the crucial friction that reasserts the primacy of a flourishing human future as the foundation of our information civilization. *If the digital future is to be our home, then it is we who must make it so.*"|Chap 5, Para 57|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
447|5|58|My methods combine those of a social scientist inclined toward theory, history, philosophy, and qualitative research with those of an essayist: an unusual but intentional approach. As an essayist, I occasionally draw upon my own experiences. I do this because the tendency toward psychic numbing is []increased when we regard the critical issues examined here as just so many abstractions attached to technological and economic forces beyond our reach. We cannot fully reckon with the gravity of surveillance capitalism and its consequences unless we can trace the scars they carve into the flesh of our daily lives.|Chap 5, Para 58|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
448|5|59|As a social scientist, I have been drawn to earlier theorists who encountered the unprecedented in their time. Reading from this perspective, I developed a fresh appreciation for the intellectual courage and pioneering insights of classic texts, in which authors such as Durkheim, Marx, and Weber boldly theorized industrial capitalism and industrial society as it rapidly constructed itself in their midst during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. My work here has also been inspired by mid-twentieth-century thinkers such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, Karl Polanyi, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Stanley Milgram, who struggled to name the unprecedented in their time as they faced the comprehension-defying phenomena of totalitarianism and labored to grasp their trail of consequence for the prospects of humanity. My work has also been deeply informed by the many insights of visionary scholars, technology critics, and committed investigative journalists who have done so much to illuminate key points on the map that emerges here.|Chap 5, Para 59|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
449|5|60|During the last seven years I have focused closely on the top surveillance capitalist firms and their growing ecosystems of customers, consultants, and competitors, all of it informed by the larger context of technology and data science that defines the Silicon Valley zeitgeist. This raises another important distinction. Just as surveillance capitalism is not the same as technology, this new logic of accumulation cannot be reduced to any single company or group of companies. The top five internet companies---Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook---are often regarded as a single entity with similar strategies and interests, but when it comes to surveillance capitalism, this is not the case.|Chap 5, Para 60|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
450|5|61|First, it is necessary to distinguish between capitalism and surveillance capitalism. As I discuss in more detail in [Chapter 3](chapter003.xhtml), that line is defined in part by the purposes and methods of data collection. When a firm collects behavioral data with permission and solely as a means to product or service improvement, it is committing capitalism but not surveillance capitalism. Each []of the top five tech companies practices capitalism, but they are not all pure surveillance capitalists, at least not now.|Chap 5, Para 61|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
451|5|62|"For example, Apple has so far drawn a line, pledging to abstain from many of the practices that I locate in the surveillance capitalist regime. Its behavior in this regard is not perfect, the line is sometimes blurred, and Apple might well change or contradict its orientation. Amazon once prided itself on its customer alignment and the virtuous circle between data collection and service improvement. Both firms derive revenues from physical and digital products and therefore experience less financial pressure to chase surveillance revenues than the pure data companies. As we see in [Chapter 9](chapter014.xhtml), however, Amazon appears to be migrating toward surveillance capitalism, with its new emphasis on ""personalized"" services and third-party revenues."|Chap 5, Para 62|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
452|5|63|Whether or not a corporation has fully migrated to surveillance capitalism says nothing about other vital issues raised by its operations, from monopolistic and anticompetitive practices in the case of Amazon to pricing, tax strategies, and employment policies at Apple. Nor are there any guarantees for the future. Time will tell if Apple succumbs to surveillance capitalism, holds the line, or perhaps even expands its ambitions to anchor an effective alternative trajectory to a human future aligned with the ideals of individual autonomy and the deepest values of a democratic society.|Chap 5, Para 63|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
453|5|64|One important implication of these distinctions is that even when our societies address capitalist harms produced by the tech companies, such as those related to monopoly or privacy, those actions do not ipso facto interrupt a firm's commitment to and continued elaboration of surveillance capitalism. For example, calls to break up Google or Facebook on monopoly grounds could easily result in establishing multiple surveillance capitalist firms, though at a diminished scale, and thus clear the way for more surveillance capitalist competitors. Similarly, reducing Google and Facebook's duopoly in online advertising does not reduce the reach of surveillance capitalism if online advertising market share is simply spread over five surveillance capitalist firms or fifty, instead of two. Throughout this book I focus on the unprecedented aspects of surveillance capitalist operations that must be contested and interrupted if this market form is to be contained and vanquished.|Chap 5, Para 64|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
454|5|65|[]My focus in these pages tends toward Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. The aim here is not a comprehensive critique of these companies as such. Instead, I view them as the petri dishes in which the DNA of surveillance capitalism is best examined. As I suggested earlier, my goal is to map a new logic and its operations, not a company or its technologies. I move across the boundaries of these and other companies in order to compile the insights that can flesh out the map, just as earlier observers moved across many examples to grasp the once-new logics of managerial capitalism and mass production. It is also the case that surveillance capitalism was invented in the United States: in Silicon Valley and at Google. This makes it an American invention, which, like mass production, became a global reality. For this reason, much of this text focuses on developments in the US, although the consequences of these developments belong to the world.|Chap 5, Para 65|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
455|5|66|"In studying the surveillance capitalist practices of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other corporations, I have paid close attention to interviews, patents, earnings calls, speeches, conferences, videos, and company programs and policies. In addition, between 2012 and 2015 I interviewed 52 data scientists from 19 different companies with a combined 586 years of experience in high-technology corporations and startups, primarily in Silicon Valley. These interviews were conducted as I developed my ""ground truth"" understanding of surveillance capitalism and its material infrastructure. Early on I approached a small number of highly respected data scientists, senior software developers, and specialists in the ""internet of things."" My interview sample grew as scientists introduced me to their colleagues. The interviews, sometimes over many hours, were conducted with the promise of confidentiality and anonymity, but my gratitude toward them is personal, and I publicly declare it here."|Chap 5, Para 66|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
456|5|67|Finally, throughout this book you will read excerpts from W. H. Auden's *Sonnets from China,* along with the entirety of Sonnet XVIII. This cycle of Auden's poems is dear to me, a poignant exploration of humanity's mythic history, the perennial struggle against violence and domination, and the transcendent power of the human spirit and its relentless claim on the future. ::: :::  [][CHAPTER TWO](toc.xhtml#toc-chapter002) |Chap 5, Para 67|05 HIJACKED: THE DIVISION OF LEARNING IN SOCIETY
457|6|5|"""The new power is *action,*"" a senior software engineer told me. ""The intelligence of the internet of things means that sensors can also be *actuators.*"" The director of software engineering for a company that is an important player in the ""internet of things"" added, ""It's no longer simply about ubiquitous computing. Now the real aim is ubiquitous intervention, action, and control. The real power is that now you can *modify* real-time actions in the real world. Connected smart sensors can register and analyze any kind of behavior and then actually figure out how to change it. Real-time analytics translate into real-time action."" The scientists and engineers I interviewed call this new capability ""actuation,"" and they describe it as the critical though largely undiscussed turning point in the evolution of the apparatus of ubiquity."|Chap 6, Para 5|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
458|6|6|"This actuation capability defines a new phase of the prediction imperative that emphasizes *economies of action*. This phase represents the completion of the new *means of behavior modification,* a decisive and necessary evolution of the surveillance capitalist ""means of production"" toward a more complex, iterative, and muscular operational system. It is a critical achievement in the race to guaranteed outcomes. Under surveillance capitalism the objectives []and operations of automated behavioral modification are designed and controlled by companies to meet their own revenue and growth objectives. As one senior engineer told me,"|Chap 6, Para 6|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
459|6|7|:::  Sensors are used to modify people's behavior just as easily as they modify device behavior. There are many great things we can do with the internet of things, like lowering the heat in all the houses on your street so that the transformer is not overloaded, or optimizing an entire industrial operation. But at the individual level, it also means the power to take actions that can override what you are doing or even put you on a path you did not choose. :::|Chap 6, Para 7|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
460|6|8|"The scientists and engineers whom I interviewed identified three key approaches to economies of action, each one aimed at achieving behavior modification. The first two I call ""tuning"" and ""herding."" The third is already familiar as what behavioral psychologists refer to as ""conditioning."" Strategies that produce economies of action vary according to the methods with which these approaches are combined and the salience of each."|Chap 6, Para 8|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
461|6|9|"""Tuning"" occurs in a variety of ways. It may involve subliminal cues designed to subtly shape the flow of behavior at the precise time and place for maximally efficient influence. Another kind of tuning involves what behavioral economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein call the ""nudge,"" which they define as ""any aspect of a choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way."" The term *choice architecture* refers to the ways in which situations are already structured to channel attention and shape action. In some cases these architectures are intentionally designed to elicit specific behavior, such as a classroom in which all the seats face the teacher or an online business that requires you to click through many obscure pages in order to opt out of its tracking cookies. The use of this term is another way of saying in behaviorist language that social situations are always already thick with tuning interventions, most of which operate outside our awareness."|Chap 6, Para 9|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
462|6|10|Behavioral economists argue a worldview based on the notion that human mentation is frail and flawed, leading to irrational choices that fail to adequately consider the wider structure of alternatives. Thaler and Sunstein have encouraged governments to actively design nudges that adequately []shepherd individual choice making toward outcomes that align with their interests, as perceived by experts. One classic example favored by Thaler and Sunstein is the cafeteria manager who nudges students to healthier food choices by prominently displaying the fruit salad in front of the pudding; another is the automatic renewal of health insurance policies as a way of protecting individuals who overlook the need for new approvals at the end of each year.|Chap 6, Para 10|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
463|6|11|"Surveillance capitalists adapted many of the highly contestable assumptions of behavioral economists as one cover story with which to legitimate their practical commitment to a unilateral commercial program of behavior modification. The twist here is that nudges are intended to encourage choices that accrue to the architect, not to the individual. The result is data scientists trained on economies of action who regard it as perfectly normal to master the art and science of the ""digital nudge"" for the sake of their company's commercial interests. For example, the chief data scientist for a national drugstore chain described how his company designs automatic digital nudges that subtly push people toward the specific behaviors favored by the company: ""You can make people do things with this technology. Even if it's just 5% of people, you've made 5% of people do an action they otherwise wouldn't have done, so to some extent there is an element of the user's loss of self-control."""|Chap 6, Para 11|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
464|6|12|"""Herding"" is a second approach that relies on controlling key elements in a person's immediate context. The uncontract is an example of a herding technique. Shutting down a car's engine irreversibly changes the driver's immediate context, herding her out the car door. Herding enables remote orchestration of the human situation, foreclosing action alternatives and thus moving behavior along a path of heightened probability that approximates certainty. ""We are learning how to write the music, and then we let the music make them dance,"" an ""internet of things"" software developer explains, adding,"|Chap 6, Para 12|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
465|6|13|":::  We can engineer the context around a particular behavior and force change that way. Context-aware data allow us to tie together your emotions, your cognitive functions, your vital signs, etcetera. We can know if you shouldn't be driving, and we can just shut your car []down. We can tell the fridge, ""Hey, lock up because he shouldn't be eating,"" or we tell the TV to shut off and make you get some sleep, or the chair to start shaking because you shouldn't be sitting so long, or the faucet to turn on because you need to drink more water. :::"|Chap 6, Para 13|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
466|6|14|"""Conditioning"" is a well-known approach to inducing behavior change, primarily associated with the famous Harvard behaviorist B. F. Skinner. He argued that behavior modification should mimic the evolutionary process, in which naturally occurring behaviors are ""selected"" for success by environmental conditions. Instead of the earlier, more simplistic model of stimulus/response, associated with behaviorists such as Watson and Pavlov, Skinner interpolated a third variable: ""reinforcement."" In his laboratory work with mice and pigeons, Skinner learned how to observe a range of naturally occurring behaviors in the experimental animal and then reinforce the specific action, or ""operant,"" that he wanted the animal to reproduce. Ultimately, he mastered intricate designs or ""schedules"" of reinforcement that could reliably shape precise behavioral routines."|Chap 6, Para 14|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
467|6|15|"Skinner called the application of reinforcements to shape specific behaviors ""operant conditioning."" His larger project was known as ""behavior modification"" or ""behavioral engineering,"" in which behavior is continuously shaped to amplify some actions at the expense of others. In the end the pigeon learns, for example, to peck a button twice in order to receive a pellet of grain. The mouse learns his way through a complicated maze and back again. Skinner imagined a pervasive ""technology of behavior"" that would enable the application of such methods across entire human populations."|Chap 6, Para 15|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
468|6|16|"As the chief data scientist for a much-admired Silicon Valley education company told me, ""Conditioning at scale is essential to the new science of massively engineered human behavior."" He believes that smartphones, wearable devices, and the larger assembly of always-on networked nodes allow his company to modify and manage a substantial swath of its users' behavior. As digital signals monitor and track a person's daily activities, the company gradually masters the schedule of reinforcements---rewards, recognition, or praise that can reliably produce the specific user behaviors that the company selects for dominance:"|Chap 6, Para 16|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
469|6|17|":::  []The goal of everything we do is to change people's actual behavior at scale. We want to figure out the construction of changing a person's behavior, and then we want to change how lots of people are making their day-to-day decisions. When people use our app, we can capture their behaviors and identify good and bad \[ones\]. Then we develop ""treatments"" or ""data pellets"" that select good behaviors. We can test how actionable our cues are for them and how profitable certain behaviors are for us. :::"|Chap 6, Para 17|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
470|6|18|"Although it is still possible to imagine automated behavioral modification without surveillance capitalism, it is not possible to imagine surveillance capitalism without the marriage of behavior modification and the technological means to automate its application. This marriage is essential to economies of action. For example, one can imagine a fitness tracker, a car, or a refrigerator whose data and operational controls are accessible exclusively to their owners for the purposes of helping them to exercise more often, drive safely, and eat healthily. But as we have already seen in so many domains, the rise of surveillance capitalism has obliterated the idea of the simple feedback loop characteristic of the behavioral value reinvestment cycle. In the end, it's not the devices; it's Max Weber's ""economic orientation,"" now determined by surveillance capitalism."|Chap 6, Para 18|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
471|6|19|"The allure of surveillance revenues drives the continuous accumulation of more and more predictive forms of behavioral surplus. The most predictive source of all is behavior that has already been modified to orient toward guaranteed outcomes. The fusion of new digital means of modification and new economic aims produces whole new ranges of techniques for creating and cornering these new forms of surplus. A study called ""Behavior Change Implemented in Electronic Lifestyle Activity Monitors"" is illustrative. Researchers from the University of Texas and the University of Central Florida studied thirteen such applications, concluding that the monitoring devices ""contain a wide range of behavior change techniques typically used in clinical behavior interventions."" The researchers conclude that behavior-change operations are proliferating as a result of their migration to digital devices and internet connectivity. They note that the very possibility of a simple loop []designed by and for the consumer seems hopelessly elusive, observing that behavior-change apps ""lend themselves... to various types of surveillance"" and that ""official methods"" of securely and simply transmitting data ""do not appear to currently exist in these apps."""|Chap 6, Para 19|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
472|6|20|"Remember that Google economist Hal Varian extolled the ""new uses"" of big data that proceed from ubiquitous computer-mediated transactions. Among these he included the opportunity for ""continuous experimentation."" Varian noted that Google has its engineering and data science teams consistently running thousands of ""A/B"" experiments that rely on randomization and controls to test user reactions to hundreds of variations in page characteristics from layout to buttons to fonts. Varian endorsed and celebrated this self-authorizing experimental role, warning that all the data in the world ""can only measure correlation, not causality."" Data tell what happened but not why it happened. In the absence of causal knowledge, even the best predictions are only extrapolations from the past."|Chap 6, Para 20|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
473|6|21|"The result of this conundrum is that the last crucial element in the construction of high-quality prediction products---i.e., those that approximate guaranteed outcomes---depends upon causal knowledge. As Varian says, ""If you really want to understand causality, you have to run experiments. And if you run experiments continuously, you can continuously improve your system."""|Chap 6, Para 21|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
474|6|22|"Because the ""system"" is intended to produce predictions, ""continuously improving the system"" means closing the gap between prediction and observation in order to approximate certainty. In an analog world, such ambitions would be far too expensive to be practical, but Varian observes that in the realm of the internet, ""experimentation can be entirely automated."""|Chap 6, Para 22|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
475|6|23|Varian awards surveillance capitalists the privilege of the experimenter's role, and this is presented as another casual fait accompli. In fact, it reflects the final critical step in surveillance capitalists' radical self-dealing of new rights. In this phase of the prediction imperative, surveillance capitalists declare their right to modify others' behavior for profit according to methods that bypass human awareness, individual decision rights, and the entire complex of self-regulatory processes that we summarize with terms such as *autonomy* and *self-determination.*|Chap 6, Para 23|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
476|6|24|"[]What follows now are two distinct narratives of surveillance capitalists as ""experimenters"" who leverage their asymmetries of knowledge to impose their will on the unsuspecting human subjects who are their users. The experimental insights accumulated through their one-way mirrors are critical to constructing, fine-tuning, and exploring the capabilities of each firm's for-profit means of behavioral modification. In Facebook's user experiments and in the augmented-reality game Pokémon Go (imagined and incubated at Google), we see the commercial means of behavioral modification evolving before our eyes. Both combine the components of economies of action and the techniques of tuning, herding, and conditioning in startling new ways that expose the Greeks secreted deep in the belly of the Trojan horse: the economic orientation obscured behind the veil of the digital."|Chap 6, Para 24|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
477|6|25|"In 2012 Facebook researchers startled the public with an article provocatively titled ""A 61-Million-Person Experiment in Social Influence and Political Mobilization,"" published in the scientific journal *Nature.* In this controlled, randomized study conducted during the run-up to the 2010 US Congressional midterm elections, the researchers experimentally manipulated the social and informational content of voting-related messages in the news feeds of nearly 61 million Facebook users while also establishing a control group."|Chap 6, Para 25|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
478|6|26|"One group was shown a statement at the top of their news feed encouraging the user to vote. It included a link to polling place information, an actionable button reading ""I Voted,"" a counter indicating how many other Facebook users reported voting, and up to six profile pictures of the user's Facebook friends who had already clicked the ""I Voted"" button. A second group received the same information but without the pictures of friends. A third control group did not receive any special message."|Chap 6, Para 26|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
479|6|27|"The results showed that users who received the social message were about 2 percent more likely to click on the ""I Voted"" button than did those who received the information alone and 0.26 percent more likely to click on polling place information. The Facebook experimenters determined that social []messaging was an effective means of tuning behavior at scale because it ""directly influenced political self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behavior of millions of people,"" and they concluded that ""showing familiar faces to users can dramatically improve the effectiveness of a mobilization message."""|Chap 6, Para 27|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
480|6|28|"The team calculated that the manipulated social messages sent 60,000 additional voters to the polls in the 2010 midterm elections, as well as another 280,000 who cast votes as a result of a ""social contagion"" effect, for a total of 340,000 additional votes. In their concluding remarks, the researchers asserted that ""we show the importance of social influence for effecting behavior change... the results suggest that online messages might influence a variety of offline behaviors, and this has implications for our understanding of the role of online social media in society...."""|Chap 6, Para 28|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
481|6|29|"The experiment succeeded by producing social cues that ""suggested"" or ""primed"" users in ways that tuned their real-world behavior toward a specific set of actions determined by the ""experimenters."" In this process of experimentation, economies of action are discovered, honed, and ultimately institutionalized in software programs and their algorithms that function automatically, continuously, ubiquitously, and pervasively to achieve economies of action. Facebook's surplus is aimed at solving one problem: how and when to intervene in the state of play that is your daily life in order to modify your behavior and thus sharply increase the predictability of your actions now, soon, and later. The challenge for surveillance capitalists is to learn how to do this effectively, automatically, and, therefore, economically, as a former Facebook product manager writes:"|Chap 6, Para 29|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS

Whether that is seeing different size ad copy, or different marketing messages, or different call-to-action buttons, or having their feeds generated by different ranking algorithms.... The fundamental purpose of most people at Facebook working on data is to influence and alter people's moods and behavior. They are doing it all the time to make you like stories more, to click on more ads, to spend more time on the site. This is just how a website works, everyone does this and everyone knows that everyone does this. :::|Chap 6, Para 30|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
483|6|31|"[]The Facebook study's publication evoked fierce debate as experts and the wider public finally began to reckon with Facebook's---and the other internet companies'---unprecedented power to persuade, influence, and ultimately manufacture behavior. Harvard's Jonathan Zittrain, a specialist in internet law, acknowledged that it was now possible to imagine Facebook quietly engineering an election, using means that its users could neither detect nor control. He described the Facebook experiment as a challenge to ""collective rights"" that could undermine ""the right of people as a whole... to enjoy the benefits of a democratic process...."""|Chap 6, Para 31|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
484|6|32|"Public concern failed to destabilize Facebook's self-authorizing practice of behavior modification at scale. Even as the social influence experiment was being debated in 2012, a Facebook data scientist was already collaborating with academic researchers on a new study, ""Experimental Evidence of Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks,"" submitted to the prestigious *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* in 2013, where it was edited by a well-known Princeton social psychologist, Susan Fiske, and published in June 2014."|Chap 6, Para 32|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS

The idea was to test whether even subliminal exposure to specific emotional content would cause people to change their own posting behavior to reflect that content. It did. Whether or not users felt happier or sadder, the tone of their expression changed to reflect their news feed."|Chap 6, Para 33|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
486|6|34|"The experimental results left no doubt that once again Facebook's carefully designed, undetectable, and uncontestable subliminal cues reached beyond the screen into the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of naive users, predictably actuating specific qualities of emotional expression through processes that operate outside the awareness of their human targets, just as Stuart MacKay had originally prescribed for Galapagos turtles and Canadian elk (see [Chapter 7](chapter012.xhtml)). ""Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness,"" the researchers proclaimed. ""Online messages influence []our experience of emotions, which may affect a variety of offline behaviors."" The team celebrated its work as ""some of the first experimental evidence to support the controversial claims that emotions can spread throughout a network,"" and they reflected on the fact that even their relatively minimal manipulation had a measurable effect, albeit a small one."|Chap 6, Para 34|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
487|6|35|"What Facebook researchers failed to acknowledge in either experiment is that a person's susceptibility to subliminal cues and his or her vulnerability to a ""contagion"" effect is largely dependent upon empathy: the ability to understand and share in the mental and emotional state of another person, including feeling another's feelings and being able to take another's point of view---sometimes characterized as ""affective"" or ""cognitive"" empathy. Psychologists have found that the more a person can project himself or herself into the feelings of another and take the other's perspective, the more likely he or she is to be influenced by subliminal cues, including hypnosis. Empathy orients people toward other people. It allows one to get absorbed in emotional experience and to resonate with others' experiences, including unconsciously mimicking another's facial expressions or body language. Contagious laughing and even contagious yawning are examples of such resonance."|Chap 6, Para 35|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
488|6|36|"Empathy is considered essential to social bonding and emotional attachment, but it can also trigger ""vicarious anxiety"" for victims or others who are genuinely distressed. Some psychologists have called empathy a ""risky strength"" because it predisposes us to experience others' happiness but also their pain. The successful tuning evident in both Facebook experiments is the result of the effective exploitation of the natural empathy present in its population of users."|Chap 6, Para 36|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
489|6|37|"The Facebook researchers claimed that the results suggested two inferences. First, in a massive and engaged population such as Facebook users, even small effects ""can have large aggregated consequences."" Second, the authors invited readers to imagine what might be accomplished with more-significant manipulations and larger experimental populations, noting the importance of their findings for ""public health."""|Chap 6, Para 37|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
490|6|38|"Once again, public outcry was substantial. ""If Facebook can tweak emotions and make us vote, what else can it do?"" the *Guardian* asked. The *Atlantic* quoted the study's editor, who had processed the article for publication []despite her apparent misgivings. She told the magazine that as a private company, Facebook did not have to adhere to the legal standards for experimentation required of academic and government researchers."|Chap 6, Para 38|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
491|6|39|"These legal standards are known as the ""Common Rule."" Designed to protect against the abuse of the experimenter's power, these standards must be adhered to by all federally funded research. The Common Rule enforces procedures for informed consent, avoidance of harm, debriefing, and transparency, and it is administered by panels of scientists, known as ""internal review boards,"" appointed within every research institution. Fiske acknowledged that she had been persuaded by Facebook's argument that the experimental manipulation was an unremarkable extension of the corporation's standard practice of manipulating people's news feeds. As Fiske recounted, ""They said... that Facebook apparently manipulates people's News Feeds all the time.... Who knows what other research they're doing."" In other words, Fiske recognized that the experiment was merely an extension of Facebook's standard practices of behavioral modification, which already flourish without sanction."|Chap 6, Para 39|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
492|6|40|"Facebook data scientist and principal researcher Adam Kramer was deluged with hundreds of media queries, leading him to write on his Facebook page that the corporation really does ""care"" about its emotional impact. One of his coauthors, Cornell's Jeffrey Hancock, told the *New York Times* that he didn't realize that manipulating the news feeds, even modestly, would make some people feel violated. The *Wall Street Journal* reported that the Facebook data science group had run more than 1,000 experiments since its inception in 2007 and operated with ""few limits"" and no internal review board. Writing in the *Guardian,* psychology professor Chris Chambers summarized that ""the Facebook study paints a dystopian future in which academic researchers escape ethical restriction by teaming up with private companies to test increasingly dangerous or harmful interventions."""|Chap 6, Para 40|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
493|6|41|"A month after the emotional contagion study's publication, the editor-in-chief of the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,* Inder M. Verma, published an ""editorial expression of concern"" regarding the Facebook research. After acknowledging the standard defense that Facebook is technically exempt from the ""Common Rule,"" Verma added, ""It is []nevertheless a matter of concern that the collection of the data by Facebook may have involved practices that were not fully consistent with the principles of obtaining informed consent and allowing participants to opt out."""|Chap 6, Para 41|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
494|6|42|"Among US scholars, University of Maryland law professor James Grimmelmann published the most comprehensive argument in favor of holding Facebook and other social media companies accountable to the standards represented by the Common Rule. Corporate research is more likely than academic research to be compromised by serious conflicts of interests, he reasoned, making common experimental standards critical and not something to be left to individual ethical judgment. Grimmelmann imagined ""Internal Review Board laundering,"" in which academics could ""circumvent research ethics regulations whenever they work just closely enough with industry partners. The exception would swallow the Common Rule."""|Chap 6, Para 42|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
495|6|43|Despite his conviction on this point, Grimmelmann acknowledged in the final pages of his analysis that even the most rigorous imposition of the Common Rule would do little to curb the immense power of a company such as Facebook that routinely manipulates user behavior at scale, using means that are indecipherable and therefore uncontestable. Like Fiske, Grimmelmann sensed the larger project of economies of action just beyond the reach of established law and social norms.|Chap 6, Para 43|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
496|6|44|"The journal *Nature* drew attention with a strongly worded letter defending the Facebook experiment, authored by bioethicist Michelle Meyer together with five coauthors and on behalf of twenty-seven other ethicists. The letter argued that the need to codify new knowledge about the online environment justifies experimentation even when it does not or cannot abide by accepted ethical guidelines for human subjects research. But Meyer's defense turned on a prescient note of warning that ""the extreme response to this study... could result in such research being done in secret.... If critics think that the manipulation of emotional content in this research is sufficiently concerning to merit regulation... then the same concern must apply to Facebook's standard practice...."""|Chap 6, Para 44|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
497|6|45|"The experiment's critics and supporters agreed on little but this: Facebook could easily turn rogue, threatening to retreat to secrecy if regulators attempted to intervene in its practices. The academic community shared a sense of threat in the face of known facts. Facebook owns an unprecedented []means of behavior modification that operates covertly, at scale, and in the absence of social or legal mechanisms of agreement, contest, and control. Even the most stringent application of the ""Common Rule"" would be unlikely to change these facts."|Chap 6, Para 45|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
498|6|46|"As scholars promised to convene panels to consider the ethical issues raised by Facebook research, the corporation announced its own plans for better self-regulation. The corporation's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, confessed to being ""unprepared"" for the public reaction to the emotional contagion study, and he admitted that ""there are things we should have done differently."" The company's ""new framework"" for research included clear guidelines, an internal review panel, a capsule on research practices incorporated into the company's famous ""boot camp"" orientation and training program for new hires, and a website to feature published academic research. These self-imposed ""regulations"" did not challenge the fundamental facts of Facebook's online community as the necessary developmental environment and target for the firm's economies of action."|Chap 6, Para 46|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
499|6|47|"A document acquired by the Australian press in May 2017 would eventually reveal this fact. Three years after the publication of the contagion study, the *Australian* broke the story on a confidential twenty-three-page Facebook document written by two Facebook executives in 2017 and aimed at the company's Australian and New Zealand advertisers. The report depicted the corporation's systems for gathering ""psychological insights"" on 6.4 million high school and tertiary students as well as young Australians and New Zealanders already in the workforce. The Facebook document detailed the many ways in which the corporation uses its stores of behavioral surplus to pinpoint the exact moment at which a young person needs a ""confidence boost"" and is therefore most vulnerable to a specific configuration of advertising cues and nudges: ""By monitoring posts, pictures, interactions, and Internet activity, Facebook can work out when young people feel 'stressed,' 'defeated,' 'overwhelmed,' 'anxious,' 'nervous,' 'stupid,' 'silly,' 'useless,' and a 'failure.'"""|Chap 6, Para 47|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
500|6|48|"The report reveals Facebook's interest in leveraging this affective surplus for the purpose of economies of action. It boasts detailed information on ""mood shifts"" among young people based on ""internal Facebook data,"" and it claims that Facebook's prediction products can not only ""detect sentiment"" but also predict how emotions are communicated at different points []during the week, matching each emotional phase with appropriate ad messaging for the maximum probability of guaranteed outcomes. ""Anticipatory emotions are more likely to be expressed early in the week,"" the analysis counsels, ""while reflective emotions increase on the weekend. Monday-Thursday is about building confidence; the weekend is for broadcasting achievements."""|Chap 6, Para 48|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
501|6|49|"Facebook publicly denied these practices, but Antonio Garcia-Martinez, a former Facebook product manager and author of a useful account of Silicon Valley titled *Chaos Monkeys,* described in the *Guardian* the routine application of such practices and accused the corporation of ""lying through their teeth."" He concluded, ""The hard reality is that Facebook will never try to limit such use of their data unless the public uproar reaches such a crescendo as to be un-mutable."" Certainly the public challenge to Facebook's insertion of itself into the emotional lives of its users, as expressed in the contagion study, and its pledge to self-regulate did not quell its commercial interest in users' emotions or the corporation's compulsion to systematically exploit that knowledge on behalf of and in collaboration with its customers. It did not, because it cannot, not as long as the company's revenues are bound to economies of action under the authority of the prediction imperative."|Chap 6, Para 49|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
502|6|50|Facebook's persistence warns us again of the dispossession cycle's stubborn march. Facebook had publicly acknowledged and apologized for its overt experimental *incursions* into behavior modification and emotional manipulation, and it promised *adaptations* to curb or mitigate these practices. Meanwhile, a new threshold of intimate life had been breached. Facebook's potential mastery of emotional manipulation became discussable and even taken for granted as *habituation* set in. From Princeton's Fiske to critic Grimmelmann and supporter Meyer, the experts believed that if Facebook's activities were to be forced into a new regulatory regime, the corporation would merely continue in secret. The Australian documents opened one door on these covert practices, suggesting the completion of the cycle with the *redirection* of action into clandestine zones protected by opacity and indecipherability, just as these scholars had anticipated.|Chap 6, Para 50|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
503|6|51|"Facebook's political mobilization experimenters discovered that they could manipulate users' vulnerabilities to social influence in order to create a motivational condition (""I want to be like my friends"") that increases the []probability that a relevant priming message---the ""I Voted"" button---will produce action. The emotional contagion study exploited the same underlying social influence orientation. In this case, Facebook planted subliminal cues in the form of positive or negative affective language, which combined with the motivational state triggered by social comparison---""I want to be like my friends""---to produce a measurable, if weak, contagion effect. Finally, the Australian ad-targeting document points to the seriousness and complexity of the backstage effort to strengthen this effect by specifying motivational conditions at a granular level. It reveals not only the scale and scope of Facebook's behavioral surplus but also the corporation's interest in leveraging its surplus to precisely determine the ebb and flow of a user's predisposition for real-time targeting by the branded cues that are most likely to achieve guaranteed outcomes."|Chap 6, Para 51|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
504|6|52|"Facebook's experimental success demonstrates that tuning through suggestion can be an effective form of telestimulation at scale. The evasion of individual and group awareness was critical to Facebook's behavior-modification success, just as MacKay had stipulated. The first paragraph of the research article on emotional contagion celebrates this evasion: ""Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their *awareness.*"" Nor do the young adults of Australia's great cities suspect that the precise measure of their fears and fantasies is exploited for commercial result at the hour and moment of their greatest vulnerability."|Chap 6, Para 52|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
505|6|53|This evasion is neither accidental nor incidental, but actually essential to the structure of the whole surveillance capitalist project. Individual awareness is the enemy of telestimulation because it is the necessary condition for the mobilization of cognitive and existential resources. There is no autonomous judgment without awareness. Agreement and disagreement, participation and withdrawal, resistance or collaboration: none of these self-regulating choices can exist without awareness.|Chap 6, Para 53|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
506|6|54|"A rich and flourishing research literature illuminates the antecedents, conditions, consequences, and challenges of human self-regulation as a universal need. The capacity for self-determination is understood as an essential foundation for many of the behaviors that we associate with critical capabilities such as empathy, volition, reflection, personal development, authenticity, []integrity, learning, goal accomplishment, impulse control, creativity, and the sustenance of intimate enduring relationships. ""Implicit in this process is a self that sets goals and standards, is *aware* of its own thoughts and behaviors, and has the capacity to change them,"" write Ohio State University professor Dylan Wagner and Dartmouth professor Todd Heatherton in an essay about the centrality of self-awareness to self-determination: ""Indeed, some theorists have suggested that the primary purpose of self awareness is to enable self-regulation."" Every threat to human autonomy begins with an assault on awareness, ""tearing down our capacity to regulate our thoughts, emotions, and desires."""|Chap 6, Para 54|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
507|6|55|"The salience of self-awareness as a bulwark against self-regulatory failure is also underscored in the work of two Cambridge University researchers who developed a scale to measure a person's ""susceptibility to persuasion."" They found that the single most important determinant of one's ability to resist persuasion is what they call ""the ability to premeditate."" This means that people who harness self-awareness to think through the consequences of their actions are more disposed to chart their own course and are significantly less vulnerable to persuasion techniques. Self-awareness also figures in the second-highest-ranking factor on their scale: commitment. People who are consciously committed to a course of action or set of principles are less likely to be persuaded to do something that violates that commitment."|Chap 6, Para 55|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
508|6|56|"We have seen already that democracy threatens surveillance revenues. Facebook's practices suggest an equally disturbing conclusion: human consciousness itself is a threat to surveillance revenues, as awareness endangers the larger project of behavior modification. Philosophers recognize ""self-regulation,"" ""self-determination,"" and ""autonomy"" as ""freedom of will."" The word *autonomy* derives from the Greek and literally means ""regulation by the self."" It stands in contrast to *heteronomy,* which means ""regulation by others."" The competitive necessity of economies of action means that surveillance capitalists must use all means available to supplant autonomous action with heteronomous action."|Chap 6, Para 56|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
509|6|57|In one sense there is nothing remarkable in observing that capitalists would prefer individuals who agree to work and consume in ways that most advantage capital. We need only to consider the ravages of the subprime mortgage industry that helped trigger the great financial crisis of 2008 or the []daily insults to human autonomy at the hands of countless industries from airlines to insurance for plentiful examples of this plain fact.|Chap 6, Para 57|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
510|6|58|However, it would be dangerous to nurse the notion that today's surveillance capitalists simply represent more of the same. This structural requirement of economies of action turns the means of behavioral modification into an engine of growth. At no other time in history have private corporations of unprecedented wealth and power enjoyed the free exercise of economies of action supported by a pervasive global architecture of ubiquitous computational knowledge and control constructed and maintained by all the advanced scientific know-how that money can buy.|Chap 6, Para 58|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
511|6|59|"Most pointedly, Facebook's declaration of experimental authority claims surveillance capitalists' prerogatives over the future course of others' behavior. In declaring the right to modify human action secretly and for profit, surveillance capitalism effectively exiles us from our own behavior, shifting the locus of control over the future tense from ""I will"" to ""You will."" Each one of us may follow a distinct path, but economies of action ensure that the path is already shaped by surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives. The struggle for power and control in society is no longer associated with the hidden facts of class and its relationship to production but rather by the hidden facts of automated engineered behavior modification."|Chap 6, Para 59|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
512|6|60|It had been a particularly grueling July afternoon in 2016. David had directed hours of contentious insurance testimony in a dusty New Jersey courtroom, where a power surge the night before had knocked out the building's fragile air-conditioning system. Then the fitful Friday commute home was cursed by a single car disabled by the heat that turned the once-hopeful flow of traffic into sludge. Finally home, he slid the car into his garage and made a beeline for the side door that opened to the laundry room and kitchen beyond. The cool air hit him like a dive into the ocean, and for the first time all day he took a deep breath. A note on the table said his wife would be back in a few minutes. He gulped down some water, made himself a drink, and climbed the stairs, heading for a long shower.|Chap 6, Para 60|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
513|6|61|"[]The doorbell rang just as the warm water hit his aching back muscles. Had she forgotten her key? Shower interrupted, he threw on a tee and shorts and ran downstairs, opening the front door to a couple of teenagers waving their cell phones in his face.

515|6|63|"David's doorbell rang four more times that evening: perfect strangers eager for access to his yard and disgruntled when he asked them to leave. Throughout the days and evenings that followed, knots of Pokémon seekers formed on his front lawn, some of them young and others long past that excuse. They held up their phones, pointing and shouting as they scanned his house and garden for the ""augmented-reality"" creatures. Looking at this small slice of world through their phones, they could see their Pokémon prey but only at the expense of everything else. They could not see a family's home or the boundaries of civility that made it a sanctuary for the man and woman who lived there. Instead, the game seized the house and the world around it, reinterpreting all of it in a vast equivalency of GPS coordinates. Here was a new kind of commercial assertion: a for-profit declaration of eminent domain in which reality is recast as an unbounded expanse of blank spaces to be sweated for others' enrichment. David wondered, *When will this end? What gives them the right? Whom do I call to make this stop?*"|Chap 6, Para 63|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
516|6|64|Without knowing it, he had been yanked from his shower to join the villagers in Broughton, England, who had taken to their streets in 2009 protesting the invasion of Google's Street View camera cars. Like them, he had been abruptly thrust into contest with surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives, and like them he would soon understand that there was no number to call, no 911 to urgently inform the appropriate authorities that a dreadful mistake had blossomed on his lawn.|Chap 6, Para 64|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
517|6|65|Back in 2009, as we saw in [Chapter 5](chapter008.xhtml), Google Maps product vice president and Street View boss John Hanke ignored the Broughton protestors, insisting that only he and Google knew what was best, not just for Broughton but for all people. Now here was Hanke again at surveillance capitalism's next frontier, this time as the founder of the company behind Pokémon Go, Niantic Labs. Hanke, you may recall, nursed an abiding determination to own the []world by mapping it. He had founded Keyhole, the satellite mapping startup funded by the CIA and later acquired by Google and rechristened as Google Earth. At Google, he was a vice president for Google Maps and a principal in its controversial push to commandeer public and private space through its Street View project.|Chap 6, Para 65|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
518|6|66|"Hanke recounts that Pokémon Go was born out of Google Maps, which also supplied most of the game's original development team. Indeed, Street View's mystery engineer, Marius Milner, had joined Hanke in this new phase of incursion. By 2010, Hanke had set up his own launch pad, Niantic Labs, inside the Google mother ship. His aim was the development of ""parallel reality"" games that would track and herd people through the very territories that Street View had so audaciously claimed for its maps. In 2015, following the establishment of the Alphabet corporate structure and well after the development of Pokémon Go, Niantic Labs was formally established as an independent company with \$30 million in funding from Google, Nintendo (the Japanese company that originally hosted Pokémon on its ""Game Boy"" devices in the late 1990s), and the Pokémon Company."|Chap 6, Para 66|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
519|6|67|"Hanke had long recognized the power of the game format as a means to achieve economies of action. While still at Google he told an interviewer, ""More than 80% of people who own a mobile device claim that they play games on their device... games are often the number 1 or number 2 activity... so for Android as an operative system, but also for Google, we think it's important for us to innovate and to be a leader in... the future of mobile gaming."""|Chap 6, Para 67|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
520|6|68|It is worth noting that Hanke chose to name his group after a nineteenth-century merchant sailing vessel undone by greed. The *Niantic* had been sold and repurposed for the more lucrative whaling trade when it set sail for San Francisco and the northern Pacific whaling grounds in 1849. The ship's captain made an unplanned stop in Panama to board hundreds of pilgrims bound for the California Gold Rush, all of them eager to pay top dollar for cramped, smelly quarters on the whaler. The captain's avarice proved fatal to the ship's prospects when those passengers infected the ship's crew with gold fever. The sailors abandoned captain and vessel upon docking in San Francisco, heading instead for gold country. Unable to continue the journey, the captain was forced to sell the ship for a pittance, leaving it wedged deep in the []sandy shallows at the foot of Clay and Montgomery streets. In 2016 Hanke took up the quest of that rebellious crew. His Niantic was bound for a new century's gold rush at the frontier of the prediction imperative's next wave of conquest: economies of action.|Chap 6, Para 68|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
521|6|69|Hanke's Pokémon Go launched in July 2016 as a different answer to the question confronting the engineers and scientists shaping the surveillance capitalist project: how can human behavior be actuated quickly and at scale, while driving it toward guaranteed outcomes? At its zenith in the summer of 2016, Pokémon Go was a surveillance capitalist's dream come true, fusing scale, scope, and actuation; yielding continuous sources of behavioral surplus; and providing fresh data to elaborate the mapping of interior, exterior, public, and private spaces. Most important, it provided a living laboratory for telestimulation at scale as the game's owners learned how to automatically condition and herd collective behavior, directing it toward real-time constellations of behavioral futures markets, with all of this accomplished just beyond the rim of individual awareness. In Hanke's approach, economies of action would be achieved through the dynamics of a game.|Chap 6, Para 69|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
522|6|70|"Niantic designed the new game to be ""played"" in the real world, not on a screen. The idea is that players should be ""going outside"" for ""adventures on foot"" in the open spaces of cities, towns, and suburbs. The game relies on ""augmented reality"" and is structured like a treasure hunt. Once you download the app from Niantic, you use GPS and your smartphone camera to hunt virtual creatures called Pokémon. The figures appear on your smartphone screen as if they are located beside you in your real-life surroundings: an unsuspecting man's backyard, a city street, a pizzeria, a park, a drugstore. Captured Pokémon are rewarded with game currencies, candies, and stardust, and are employed to battle other users. The ultimate goal is to capture a comprehensive array of the 151 Pokémon, but along the way players earn ""experience points,"" rising to successive levels of expertise. At level five, players can join one of three teams to battle Pokémon at designated sites referred to as ""gyms."""|Chap 6, Para 70|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
523|6|71|"The ramp-up had begun years earlier with Ingress, Niantic's first mobile game designed for real-world play. Released in 2012, Ingress was a precursor and test bed for the capabilities and methods that would define Pokémon Go. The game drove its users through their cities and towns to find and control designated ""portals"" and capture ""territory"" as the game masters relied on []GPS to track users' movements and map the territories through which they roamed."|Chap 6, Para 71|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
524|6|72|"Hanke reflected on what he and his team had learned from Ingress. Most important was the Niantic team's ""surprise"" as they observed how much ""the behavior of the players changes."" Hanke grasped that the seeds of behavior modification were planted in the game's rules and social dynamic: ""If you want to turn the world into your game board, the places you want people to interact with have to have certain characteristics.... There should be a reason for the player to go there.... The game is enabling them and nudging you to have those interactions."" One user whose Ingress name was ""Spottiswoode"" provides an example: ""As I cycle home, I stop near a location I'd scouted out previously, one with a weak enemy portal. I attack, using built-up XM (""exotic matter"") to destroy the enemy infrastructure.... On Ingress's built-in chat client, a player called Igashu praises my handiwork. 'Good job, Spottiswoode,' he says. I feel proud and move on, plotting my next assault upon the enemy's portals."" According to Hanke, Pokémon Go would be designed to leverage what the team now understood as the key sources of motivation that induce players to change their behavior: a social gaming community based on real-world action."|Chap 6, Para 72|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
525|6|73|"All games circumscribe behavior with rules, rewarding some forms of action and punishing others, and Niantic is not the first to employ the structure of a game as a means of effecting behavior change in its players. Indeed, ""gamification"" as an approach to behavioral engineering is a subject of intense interest that has produced a robust academic and popular literature. According to Wharton professor Kevin Werbach, games include three tiers of action. At the highest level are the ""dynamics"" that drive the motivational energy of the game. These can be emotions aroused by competition or frustration, a compelling narrative, a structure of progression that creates the experience of development toward a higher goal, or relationships that produce feelings such as team spirit or aggression. Next are the ""mechanics."" These are the procedural building blocks that drive the action and also build engagement. For example, a game may be structured as a competition or a solo challenge, as turn taking and cooperation, as transactions and winner take all, as team sport or individual conquest. Finally, there are the game ""components"" that operationalize the mechanics. These are the most-visible aspects []of a game: points to represent progress, quests laid out as predefined challenges, ""badges"" to represent achievements, ""leader boards"" to visually display all players' progress, ""boss fights"" to mark the culmination of a level, and so forth."|Chap 6, Para 73|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
526|6|74|"Most research on games concludes that these structures can be effective at motivating action, and researchers generally predict that games will increasingly be used as the methodology of choice to change individual behavior. In practice, this has meant that the power of games to change behavior is shamelessly instrumentalized as gamification spreads to thousands of situations in which a company merely wants to tune, herd, and condition the behavior of its customers or employees toward its own objectives. Typically, this involves importing a few components, such as reward points and levels of advancement, in order to engineer behaviors that serve the company's immediate interests, with programs such as customer loyalty schemes or internal sales competitions. One analyst compiled a survey of more than ninety such ""gamification cases,"" complete with return-on-investment statistics. Ian Bogost, a professor of interactive computing at Georgia Tech and a digital culture observer, insists that these systems should be called ""exploitationware"" rather than games because their sole aim is behavior manipulation and modification."|Chap 6, Para 74|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
527|6|75|Pokémon Go takes these capabilities in a wholly new direction, running game players through the real world, but not for the sake of the game they think they are playing. Hanke's unique genius is to point the game's behavior-modification efforts toward a target that occupies an unexplored zone beyond the boundaries of players' awareness. It aims to shape behavior in an even larger game of surveillance capitalism.|Chap 6, Para 75|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
528|6|76|"Pokémon Go was first unveiled to the *Wall Street Journal* in September 2015, shortly after Niantic's spin-off from Google. The game masters told the reporter that the game would not include ads. Instead, revenues would accrue from ""microtransactions,"" presumably in-game purchases of virtual paraphernalia, although Niantic ""declined to say"" exactly what would be for sale. Niantic also promised a location-tracking bracelet that ""vibrates and lights up"" when a person approaches a Pokémon. It was clear that Pokémon Go would at least be a fresh source of surplus for refining and expanding the maps upon which the game depended."|Chap 6, Para 76|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
529|6|77|[]Released in the US, Australia, and New Zealand on July 6, 2016, Pokémon Go became the most downloaded and highest-grossing app in the US within only a week, quickly achieving as many active Android users as Twitter. More than 60 percent of the app's downloads were in daily use, and by July 8 that translated into a daily average of about 43.5 minutes per user. With Niantic's servers groaning under the strain, the game's European rollout was delayed until July 13. By that time, however, Niantic had proved the value of its approach to economies of action, demonstrating unprecedented effectiveness in traversing that last tortured mile to guaranteed outcomes.|Chap 6, Para 77|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
530|6|78|"The unprecedented pattern was faintly discernible within days of the game's launch. A Virginia bar offered a discount to a Pokémon Go team; a tea shop in San Francisco offered a ""buy one get one free"" to the game's players. The owner of a pizza bar in Queens, New York, paid about \$10 for ""Lure Modules,"" a bit of virtual game paraphernalia intended to attract Pokémon to a specific location, successfully producing virtual creatures on bar stools and in bathroom stalls. During the first weekend of game play, the bar's food and drink sales shot up by 30 percent and later were reported to be 70 percent above average. Bloomberg reporters gushed that the game had achieved the retailers' elusive dream of using location tracking to drive foot traffic: ""It's easy to imagine a developer selling ads within the game world to local merchants, or even auctioning off the promise to turn specific shops and restaurants into destinations for players."" Hanke hinted to the *New York Times* that these real-world, real-time markets had been the plan all along. ""Niantic has cut deals like that for Ingress,"" the paper reported, ""and Mr. Hanke said the company would announce sponsored locations for Pokémon Go in the future."""|Chap 6, Para 78|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
531|6|79|"The future came quickly. Within a week the basic elements of surveillance capitalism's logic of accumulation were in place and were heralded as brilliant. As Hanke explained, ""The game relies on a lot of modern cell phone and data technology to power the augmented reality, but that traffic generated by the game also changes what happens in the real world."" By July 12, the *Financial Times* exulted that ""speculation has surged over the game's future power as a cash cow to retailers and other cravers of footfall."" Nintendo shares were up 52 percent, adding \$10.2 billion to its market capitalization."|Chap 6, Para 79|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
532|6|80|"Earlier promises that the game would not serve ads turned out to be a technical claim that required careful parsing. In fact, the surveillance-based []logic of online advertising had not disappeared. Rather, it had morphed into its physical-world mirror image, just as Sidewalk Labs' Dan Doctoroff had imagined for the ""Google city,"" a precise extension of the methods and purposes honed in the online world but now amplified in ""reality"" under pressure from the prediction imperative (see [Chapter 7](chapter012.xhtml))."|Chap 6, Para 80|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
533|6|81|"By July 13, Hanke admitted to the *Financial Times* that in addition to ""in-app payments"" for game kit, ""there is a second component to our business model at Niantic, which is the concept of *sponsored locations.*"" He explained that this new revenue stream had always been in the plan, noting that companies will ""pay us to be locations within the virtual game board---the premise being that it is an inducement that drives foot traffic."" These sponsors, Hanke explained, would be charged on a *""cost per visit""* basis, similar to the *""cost per click""* used in Google's search advertising."|Chap 6, Para 81|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
534|6|82|"The notion of ""sponsored locations"" is a euphemism for Niantic's behavioral futures markets, ground zero in Hanke's new gold rush. The elements and dynamics of the game, combined with its novel augmented-reality technology, operate to herd populations of game players through the real-world monetization checkpoints constituted by the game's actual customers: the entities who pay to play on the real-world game board, lured by the promise of guaranteed outcomes."|Chap 6, Para 82|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
535|6|83|"For a while it seemed that everyone was making money. Niantic inked a deal with McDonald's to drive game users to its 30,000 Japanese outlets. A British mall owner commissioned ""recharging teams"" to roam his malls with portable rechargers for game users. Starbucks announced that it would ""join in with the fun,"" with 12,000 of its US stores becoming official ""Pokéstops"" or ""gyms,"" along with a new ""Pokémon Go Frappuccino... the perfect treat for any Pokémon trainer on the go."" Another deal with Sprint would convert 10,500 Sprint retail and service outlets into Pokémon hubs. The music streaming company Spotify reported a tripling of Pokémon-related music sales. A UK insurance company offered special coverage for mobile phones, warning, ""Don't let accidental damage get in the way of catching them all."" Disney admitted that it was disappointed with its own strategies for ""the blending of physical and digital to create new kinds of connected play experiences"" and planned to transform its mammoth toy business ""in a direction similar to Pokémon Go."""|Chap 6, Para 83|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
536|6|84|"[]The zeal for Pokémon Go gradually diminished, but the impact of Hanke's accomplishments is indelible. ""We've only just scratched the surface,"" Hanke told a crowd of fans. The game had demonstrated that it was possible to achieve economies of action on a global scale while simultaneously directing specific individual actions toward precise local market opportunities where high bidders enjoy an ever-closer approximation of guaranteed outcomes."|Chap 6, Para 84|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
537|6|85|Niantic's distinctive accomplishment was to manage gamification as a way to guarantee outcomes for its actual customers: companies participating in the behavioral futures markets that it establishes and hosts. Hanke's game proved that surveillance capitalism could operate in the real world much as it does in the virtual one, using its unilateral knowledge (scale and scope) to shape your behavior now (action) in order to more accurately predict your behavior later. The logical inference is that real-world revenues will increase in proportion to the company's ability to match persons with locations, just as Google learned to wield surplus as a means of targeting online ads to specific individuals.|Chap 6, Para 85|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
538|6|86|"These requirements suggest that Niantic would conduct its operations in ways that establish substantial surplus supply chains aimed at scale and scope. Indeed, the company's ""surveillance policy"" signals its demand for behavioral data in excess of what is reasonable for effective game operations. Just six days after the game's release in July 2016, *BuzzFeed* reporter Joseph Bernstein advised Pokémon users to check how much data the app was collecting from their phones. According to his analysis, ""Like most apps that work with the GPS in your smartphone, Pokémon Go can tell a lot of things about you based on your movement as you play: where you go, when you went there, how you got there, how long you stayed, and who else was there. And, like many developers who build those apps, Niantic keeps that information."" Whereas other location-based apps might collect similar data, Bernstein concluded that ""Pokémon Go's incredibly granular, block-by-block map data, combined with its surging popularity, may soon make it one of, if not *the most,* detailed location-based social graphs ever compiled."""|Chap 6, Para 86|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
539|6|87|"The industry news site *TechCrunch* raised similar concerns regarding the game's data-collection practices, questioning ""the long list of permissions the app requires."" Those permissions included the camera, yes, but also []permission to ""read your contacts"" and ""find accounts on device."" Niantic's ""surveillance policy"" notes that it may share ""aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for research and analysis, demographic profiling, and other similar purposes."" *TechCrunch* noted the game's ""precise location tracking"" and ""ability to perform audio fingerprinting"" through its access to your camera and microphone, concluding, ""So it's prudent to expect some of your location data to end up in Google's hands."" The Electronic Privacy Information Center noted in a letter of complaint to the Federal Trade Commission that Niantic had failed to provide compelling reasons for the ""scope"" of the information that it routinely gathers from users' phones and Google profiles. Nor had it set limits on how long it would retain, use, or share location data. As the letter concluded, ""There is no evidence that Niantic's collection and retention of location data is necessary to the function of the game or otherwise provides a benefit to consumers that outweighs the privacy and safety harms it creates."""|Chap 6, Para 87|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
540|6|88|"By mid-July 2016, Niantic received a letter from US Senator Al Franken querying the company's privacy practices. Niantic's late-August response is instructive, a marvel of misdirection and secrecy that focuses on the game's mechanics and discloses nothing about its business model or the more comprehensive logic of accumulation behind the model: ""Pokémon Go has already been praised by public health officials, teachers, mental health workers, parents, park officials, and ordinary citizens around the world as an app that promotes healthy play and discovery."" Though acknowledging the range of data it collects as a condition of play---location services, photos, media, files, camera, contacts, and network provider data---Niantic insists that data are used ""to provide and improve"" its services. However, it does not acknowledge that its services operate on two levels: game services for players and prediction services for Niantic's customers. The company concedes that it uses third-party services, including Google's, to ""collect and interpret data,"" but it is careful to sidestep the aims of those analyses."|Chap 6, Para 88|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
541|6|89|"The seven-page letter mentions ""sponsored locations"" only once, noting that sponsors receive reports about visits and game actions. There is no reference to ""cost per visit"" or the surplus that will be required to drive that metric, in the same way that Google's ""cost per click"" depended upon behavioral []surplus drawn from online activity. Niantic's self-presentation carefully conceals its objectives in the design and development of economies of action that drive real-world, real-time behavior toward Niantic's behavioral futures markets."|Chap 6, Para 89|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
542|6|90|The genius of Pokémon Go was to transform the game you see into a higher-order game of surveillance capitalism, a game about a game. The players who took the city as their board, roaming its parks and pizzerias, unwittingly constituted a wholly different kind of human game board for this second and more consequential game. The players in this other *real* game could not be found in the clot of enthusiasts waving their phones at the edge of David's lawn. In the real game, prediction products take the form of protocols that impose forms of telestimulation intended to prod and herd people across real-world terrains to spend their real-world money in the real-world commercial establishments of Niantic's flesh-and-blood behavioral futures markets.|Chap 6, Para 90|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
543|6|91|"Niantic itself is like a tiny probe rising from the immensity of Google's mapping capabilities, surplus flows, means of production, and vast server farms as it constructs and tests the prototype of a global means of behavior modification owned and operated by surveillance capitalism. Niantic discovered that in the rapture of engaging competitive social play, the dreaded friction of individual will voluntarily gives way to game protocols that set the conditions for ""natural selection."" In this way the game automatically elicits and breeds the specific behaviors sought by the high rollers in Niantic's behavioral futures markets. With this second game board in motion, the players in the real game vie for proximity to the wake of cash that follows each smiling member of the herd."|Chap 6, Para 91|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
544|6|92|In the end we recognize that the probe was designed to explore the next frontier: the means of behavioral modification. The game about the game is, in fact, an experimental facsimile of surveillance capitalism's design for our future. It follows the prediction imperative to its logical conclusion, in which data about us in scale and scope combine with actuation mechanisms that align our behavior with a new market cosmos. All the flows of surplus from all the spaces, all the things, all the bodies, all the laughter, and all the tears are finally aimed at this triumph of certain outcomes and the revenue that it can unleash.|Chap 6, Para 92|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
545|6|93|The new global means of behavioral modification that we see under construction at Facebook and Niantic represent a new regressive age of *autonomous capital* and *heteronomous individuals,* when the very possibilities of democratic flourishing and human fulfillment depend upon the reverse. This unprecedented state of affairs rises above debates about the Common Rule. It goes to the heart of our allegiance to the ideals of a democratic society, with full knowledge of the challenges that burden those ideals.|Chap 6, Para 93|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
546|6|94|What has been forgotten here is that the Common Rule was the product of a similar challenge to principles of individual autonomy and democratic fidelity. It was one result of a deeply contested struggle in which democratically minded public officials joined with social activists, scholars, and litigators to resist the design, development, and deployment of behavioral modification as a mode of governmental power. It was not long ago that US society mobilized to resist, regulate, and control the means of behavioral modification, and it is this history that we can now draw upon to rediscover our bearings and rouse our awareness.|Chap 6, Para 94|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
547|6|95|"In 1971 the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, led by North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin and including luminaries from across the political spectrum such as Edward Kennedy, Birch Bayh, Robert Byrd, and Strom Thurmond, undertook what would become a multiyear investigation into ""a variety of programs designed to predict, control, and modify human behavior."" Ervin was a conservative Democrat and constitutional expert who became an unlikely civil liberties hero for his defense of democracy during the Watergate crisis as chair of the Senate Watergate Committee. In this case the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights would subject the principles and applications of behavior modification to intense constitutional scrutiny for the first time, questioning and ultimately rejecting the use of behavioral modification as an extension of state power."|Chap 6, Para 95|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
548|6|96|"The Senate investigation was triggered by a growing sense of public alarm at the spread of psychological techniques for behavior control. There were many points of origin, but most salient was the influence of the cold war and the range of psychological techniques and programs for behavior []modification that it had bred. The Korean War had publicized communist ""brainwashing"" techniques that, according to then newly appointed CIA Director Allen Dulles, had reduced US prisoners of war to a state of robotic passivity, in which the victim's brain ""becomes a phonograph playing a disc put on its spindle by an outside genius over which it has no control."" America's enemies appeared to be on the verge of mastering the art and science of ""mind control"" with psychological and pharmacological methods unknown to the US military. There were reports of Chinese and Soviet achievements in the remote alteration of a subject's mental capacities and the elimination of his ""free will."" Dulles committed the agency to rapid research in and development of ""mind control"" capabilities, from ""de-patterning"" and ""rewiring"" an individual to shaping an entire country's attitudes and actions."|Chap 6, Para 96|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
549|6|97|"Thus began a morbidly fascinating and often bizarre chapter in the history of American spy craft. Much of the new work was conducted in the context of the CIA's highly classified MKUltra project, which was tasked with ""research and development of chemical, biological, and radiological materials capable for employment in clandestine operations to control human behavior."" According to testimony in the 1975 Senate investigation of covert CIA Foreign and Military Intelligence operations, a 1963 Inspector General's report on MKUltra noted several reasons for the program's secrecy, but chief among them was the fact that behavior modification was seen as illegitimate. ""Research in the manipulation of human behavior is considered by many authorities in medicine and related fields to be professionally unethical, therefore the reputation of professional participants in the MKUltra program are on occasion in jeopardy,"" the report began. It also noted that many of the program's activities were illegal, violated the rights and interests of US citizens, and would alienate public opinion."|Chap 6, Para 97|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
550|6|98|"Key to our interests is the growth and elaboration of behavioral modification as an extension of political power. To this end, CIA ""demand"" summoned an ever-more-audacious supply of behavioral-modification research and practical applications from academic psychologists. Scientists from the fields of medicine and psychology set out to demystify Chinese brainwashing techniques, reinterpreting them through the established frameworks of behavior modification."|Chap 6, Para 98|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
551|6|99|"[]Their research concluded that ""mind control"" was better understood as a complex system of conditioning based on unpredictable schedules of reinforcement, consistent with B. F. Skinner's important discoveries on operant conditioning. According to Harvard historian Rebecca Lemov, the ""mind control"" researchers had a powerful effect on the CIA and other branches of the military. The notion that ""human material was changeable""---that one's personality, identity, awareness, and capacity for self-determining behavior could be crushed, eliminated, and replaced by external control---incited a new sense of panic and vulnerability: ""If indeed the world was rife with threats to the inner as much as the outer man, then experts in these realms were needed more than ever. Many good and well-meaning professors---self-described or de facto human engineers---participated in the CIA's programs to bring about slow or rapid change in the minds and behavior of people."""|Chap 6, Para 99|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
552|6|100|"By the time the senators on the Constitutional Rights Subcommittee convened in 1971, the migration of behavior-modification practices from military to civilian applications was well underway. Behavior-modification techniques had dispersed from government-funded (typically CIA) psychology labs and military psyops to a range of institutional applications, each driven by a mission to reengineer the defective personalities of captive individuals in settings that offered ""total control"" or close to it, including prisons, psychiatric wards, classrooms, institutions for the mentally challenged, schools for the autistic, and factories."|Chap 6, Para 100|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
553|6|101|"The subcommittee was emboldened to act when public concern bubbled over into outrage at the mainstreaming of these behavior-modification programs. Historian of psychology Alexandra Rutherford observes that Skinnerian behavior-modification practices expanded rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s, achieving some ""remarkable successes"" but also exposing practitioners to the scrutiny of an often-hostile public. A number of journalistic accounts raised alarms about the zealousness with which behavior-modification techniques were applied and the sense that they debased their subjects, violated ethical considerations, and infringed on fundamental civil liberties."|Chap 6, Para 101|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
554|6|102|"Another factor was the 1971 publication of B. F. Skinner's incendiary social meditation *Beyond Freedom & Dignity.* Skinner prescribed a future based on behavioral control, rejecting the very idea of freedom (as well as every tenet of a liberal society) and cast the notion of human dignity as an accident []of self-serving narcissism. Skinner imagined a pervasive ""technology of behavior"" that would one day enable the application of behavior-modification methods across entire human populations."|Chap 6, Para 102|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
555|6|103|"The ensuing storm of controversy made *Beyond Freedom & Dignity* an international best seller. ""Skinner's science of human behavior, being quite vacuous, is as congenial to the libertarian as to the fascist,"" wrote Noam Chomsky in a widely read review of the book. ""It would be not absurd but grotesque to argue that since circumstances can be arranged under which behavior is quite predictable---as in a prison, for example, or... concentration camp.... therefore there need be no concern for the freedom and dignity of 'autonomous man.'"" (In the mid-1970s graduate department at Harvard where I studied and Skinner professed, many students referred to the book as *Toward Slavery and Humiliation.*)"|Chap 6, Para 103|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
556|6|104|From the first lines of the preface of the subcommittee's 1974 report, authored by Senator Ervin, it should be evident to any twenty-first-century captive of surveillance capitalism that US society has undergone a social discontinuity more profound than the mere passage of decades suggests. It is worth reading Ervin's own words, to grasp the passion with which he located the subcommittee's work at the heart of the Enlightenment project, pledging to defend the liberal ideals of freedom and dignity:|Chap 6, Para 104|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
557|6|105|":::  When the founding fathers established our constitutional system of government, they based it on their fundamental belief in the sanctity of the individual.... They understood that self-determination is the source of individuality, and individuality is the mainstay of freedom.... Recently, however, technology has begun to develop new methods of behavior control capable of altering not just an individual's actions but his very personality and manner of thinking... the behavioral technology being developed in the United States today touches upon the most basic sources of individuality and the very core of personal freedom... the most serious threat... is the power this technology gives one man to impose his views and values on another.... Concepts of freedom, privacy and self-determination inherently conflict with programs designed to control not just physical freedom, but the source of free thought as well.... The question []becomes even more acute when these programs are conducted, as they are today, in the absence of strict controls. As disturbing as behavior modification may be on a theoretical level, the unchecked growth of the practical technology of behavior control is cause for even greater concern."" :::"|Chap 6, Para 105|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
558|6|106|"The report's critique of behavior modification has unique relevance for our time. It begins by asking a question that we must also ask: ""How did they get away with it?"" Their answer invokes the ""exceptionalism"" of that era. Just as surveillance capitalism was initially able to root and flourish under the protection of a so-called ""war against terror"" and the compulsion for certainty that it stirred, in the middle of the twentieth century the means of behavioral modification migrated from the lab to the world at large primarily under the cover of cold-war anxieties. Later, the behavior-change professionals of the 1960s and 1970s were summoned into civilian practice by a society turned fearful after years of urban riots, political protests, and rising levels of crime and ""delinquency."" The senators reasoned that calls for ""law and order"" had motivated the search for ""immediate and efficient means to control violence and other forms of anti-social behavior. The interest in controlling violence replaced more time-consuming attempts to understand its sources."""|Chap 6, Para 106|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
559|6|107|"With so many behavior-modification programs aimed at involuntary populations in state prisons and mental institutions, the senators recognized that the means of behavioral modification had to be reckoned with as a form of state power and questioned the government's constitutional right to ""control"" citizens' behavior and mentation. In its survey of government agencies, the subcommittee found ""a wide variety of behavior modification techniques... presently employed in the United States under the auspices of the federal government"" and observed that ""with the rapid proliferation of behavior modification techniques, it is all the more disturbing that few real efforts have been made to consider the basic issues of individual freedom involved and... fundamental conflicts between individual rights and behavior technology."""|Chap 6, Para 107|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
560|6|108|"The senators reserved their most vivid rebukes for what they considered as the two most extreme and pernicious behavior-modification techniques. The first was psychosurgery. The second was ""electrophysiology,"" defined as []""the use of mechanical devices to control various aspects of human behavior."" The report notes with special horror the example of ""devices"" designed to be worn by a subject ""constantly to monitor and control his behavior through a computer"" and to ""prevent a suspected behavior from occurring."""|Chap 6, Para 108|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
561|6|109|"The First Amendment, the subcommittee argued, ""must equally protect the individual's right to generate ideas,"" and the right to privacy should protect citizens from intrusions into their thoughts, behavior, personality, and identity lest these concepts ""become meaningless."" It was in this context that Skinnerian behavioral engineering was singled out for critical examination: ""A major segment of the emerging behavior control technology is concerned with conditioning, through which various forms of persuasion are used to stimulate certain types of behaviors while suppressing others."""|Chap 6, Para 109|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
562|6|110|"In anticipation of future gamification techniques as means of behavioral modification, the subcommittee report also noted with apprehension more ""benign"" approaches that relied on ""positive reinforcement,"" from ""gold-star incentives"" to elaborate reward systems, in order ""to restructure personality through artificially applied techniques."" The generalized obsession with controlling violence had also produced methods of ""behavior prediction"" that ""raise profound questions with respect to due process, privacy, and individual liberties."" A psychologist writing in the American Psychological Association's journal *Monitor* in 1974 sounded the alert, warning colleagues who touted their ability to ""control behavior"" that they were now ""viewed with increasing suspicion, if not revulsion, and threatened with restriction... *The social control of behavior control is underway.*"""|Chap 6, Para 110|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
563|6|111|"The subcommittee's work had enduring consequences. Not only did prisoners' and patients' rights groups gain momentum in their efforts to end the behavioral oppression suffered in public institutions, but psychologists also began to discuss the need to professionalize their discipline with clear ethical standards, accreditation procedures, training programs, and career ladders. The National Research Act, passed in 1974, stipulated the creation of institutional review boards and laid the foundation for the evolution and institutionalization of the Common Rule for the ethical treatment of human subjects, from which Facebook famously held itself exempt. That same year, Congress established the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. When the commission []published its findings five years later in the ""Belmont Report,"" it became the professional standard for imposing ethical guidelines on all federally funded research with human subjects in the US."|Chap 6, Para 111|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
564|6|112|"The clamorous rights consciousness of the 1970s drove behavior modification from civilian life, or at least dimmed its star. A Federal Bureau of Prisons official recommended that program leaders avoid using ""the term 'behavioral modification' but to talk about positive reward and reinforcements for the type of behavior we are attempting to instill."" Another said, ""We're doing what we always did... but to call it 'behavior modification' just makes things more difficult."" Skinner's 1976 ""primer,"" titled *About Behaviorism,* motivated by what he believed were public misconceptions stirred by the wave of harsh reaction to *Beyond Freedom & Dignity,* failed to capture much public attention. According to Skinner's biographer, ""the battle had climaxed."" The public had made *Beyond Freedom & Dignity* a bestseller ""but had just as surely rejected Skinner's argument that there were cultural matters more important than preserving and extending individual freedom."""|Chap 6, Para 112|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
565|6|113|"Most fascinating is that throughout these years of anxiety and debate, it was impossible to imagine the means of behavioral modification as anything other than owned and operated by the government: a privileged modality of state power. A 1966 *Harvard Law Review* article addressed issues of electronic tracking, surveillance, and behavioral control, reasoning that it would ""consider governmental attempts to change conduct, *since these seem more likely than private attempts.*"" The democratic impulse of US society, repelled by the excesses of its intelligence agencies, their support of criminal activities undertaken by the Nixon administration, and the migration of behavior modification as a means of disciplinary control in state institutions, led to the rejection of behavioral modification as an extension of governmental power."|Chap 6, Para 113|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
566|6|114|Unknown to the senators, scholars, rights activists, litigators, and many other citizens who stood against the antidemocratic incursions of the behavioral engineering vision, these methods had not died. The project would resurface in a wholly unexpected incarnation as *a creature of the market,* its unprecedented digital capabilities, scale, and scope now flourishing under the flag of surveillance capitalism. During the same years that US democratic forces combined to resist behavior modification as a form of state power, the energies of capitalist counterinsurgency were already at work within society. []The corporation was to enjoy the rights of personhood but be free of democratic obligations, legal constraints, moral calculations, and social considerations. Certainly in the US case, a weakened state in which elected officials depend upon corporate wealth in every election cycle has shown little appetite to contest behavior modification as a market project, let alone to stand for the moral imperatives of the autonomous individual.|Chap 6, Para 114|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
567|6|115|"In its latest incarnation, behavioral modification comes to life as a global digital market architecture unfettered by geography, independent of constitutional constraints, and formally indifferent to the risks it poses to freedom, dignity, or the sustenance of the liberal order that Ervin's subcommittee was determined to defend. This contrast is even more distressing in light of the fact that in the mid-twentieth century, the means of behavior modification were aimed at individuals and groups who were construed as ""them"": military enemies, prisoners, and other captives of walled disciplinary regimes."|Chap 6, Para 115|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
568|6|116|"Today's means of behavioral modification are aimed unabashedly at ""us."" Everyone is swept up in this new market dragnet, including the psychodramas of ordinary, unsuspecting fourteen-year-olds approaching the weekend with anxiety. Every avenue of connectivity serves to bolster private power's need to seize behavior for profit. Where is the hammer of democracy now, when the threat comes from your phone, your digital assistant, your Facebook login? Who will stand for freedom now, when Facebook threatens to retreat into the shadows if we dare to be the friction that disrupts economies of action that have been carefully, elaborately, and expensively constructed to exploit our natural empathy, elude our awareness, and circumvent our prospects for self-determination? If we fail to take notice now, how long before we are numb to this incursion and to all the incursions? How long until we notice nothing at all? How long before we forget who we were before they owned us, bent over the old texts of self-determination in the dim light, the shawl around our shoulders, magnifying glass in hand, as if deciphering ancient hieroglyphs?"|Chap 6, Para 116|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
569|6|117|Throughout these chapters we have returned to the essential questions that define the division of learning: *Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?* As to who knows, we have seen the titanic agglomerations of knowledge about our behavior in the shadow text, from vast patterns across populations to the intimate detail of individual lives. These new information []territories are private and privileged, known only to the machines, their priests, and the market participants who pay to play in these new spaces. Although it is obviously the case that we are excluded because the knowledge is not for us, these chapters have revealed a deeper structural basis for our exclusion. Now we know that *surveillance capitalists' ability to evade our awareness is an essential condition for knowledge production.* We are excluded because we are friction that impedes the elaboration of the shadow text and with it surveillance capitalism's knowledge dominance.|Chap 6, Para 117|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
570|6|118|As to who decides, this division of learning has been decided by the declarations and incursions of the owners of private surveillance capital as another essential condition of accumulation, enabled by the reluctance of the state to assert democratic oversight in this secret realm. Finally, there is the question of who decides who decides. So far, it is the asymmetrical power of surveillance capital unencumbered by law that decides who decides.|Chap 6, Para 118|06 THE REALITY BUSINESS
571|6|119|"The commodification of behavior under the conditions of surveillance capitalism pivots us toward a societal future in which an exclusive division of learning is protected by secrecy, indecipherability, and expertise. Even when knowledge derived from your behavior is fed back to you in the first text as a quid pro quo for participation, the parallel secret operations of the shadow text capture surplus for crafting into prediction products destined for other marketplaces that are *about you* rather than *for you.* These markets do not depend upon you except first as a source of raw material from which surplus is derived, and then as a target for guaranteed outcomes. We have no formal control because we are not essential to the market action. In this future we are exiles from our own behavior, denied access to or control over knowledge derived from our experience.

These are but a few of the lamentations plucked from one thousand student participants in an international study of media use that spanned ten countries and five continents.

The result was that a majority in every country admitted that they could not last out the day unplugged. Their angst was compounded by the same Faustian pact with which we are all too familiar, as they discovered that nearly all daily logistical, communicative, and informational requirements were dependent upon their connected devices: ""Meeting with friends became difficult or impossible, finding the way to a destination without an online map or access to the internet became a problem, and simply organizing an evening at home became a challenge.""

Indeed, Facebook's early advantage in this work arose in no small measure from the simple fact that its founders and []original designers were themselves adolescents and emerging adults. They designed practices for an imagined universe of adolescent users and college students, and those practices were later institutionalized for the rest of us, reducing the social world to a tally of ""friends"" who are not friends and ""likes"" that provide a continuous ticker tape of one's value on the social market, stoking the anxieties of pre-adulthood and anticipating the mesmerizing social disciplines of the hive."|Chap 7, Para 8|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA

Consider first the older cohorts. A 2012 survey concluded that emerging adults devote more time to using media than any other daily activity, spending nearly twelve hours each day with media of some form. By 2018 Pew Research reported that nearly 40 percent of young people ages 18--29 report being online ""almost constantly,"" as do 36 percent of those ages 30--49. Generation Z intensifies the trend: 95 percent use smartphones, and 45 percent of teens say they are online ""on a near-constant basis."" If that is how you spend your days and nights, then the findings of a 2016 study are all too logical, as 42 percent of teenage respondents said that social media affects how people see them, having adopted what the researchers call an *outside-looking-in* approach to how they express themselves.

Schüll learned that addictive players seek neither entertainment nor the mythical jackpot of cash. Instead, they chase what Harvard Medical School addiction researcher Howard Shaffer calls ""the capacity of the drug or gamble to shift subjective experience,"" pursuing an experiential state that Schüll calls the ""machine zone,"" a state of self-forgetting in which one is carried along by an irresistible momentum that feels like one is ""played by the machine."" The machine zone achieves a sense of complete immersion that recalls Klein's description of Facebook's design principles---engrossing, immersive, immediate---and is associated with a loss of self-awareness, automatic behavior, and a total rhythmic absorption carried along on a wave of compulsion. Eventually, every aspect of casino machine design was geared to echo, enhance, and intensify the hunger for that subjective shift, but always in ways that elude the player's awareness."|Chap 7, Para 19|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA

These innovations drive up revenues with the sheer volume of extended play as each machine is transformed into a ""personalized reward device."" The idea, as the casinos came to understand it, is to avoid anything that distracts, diverts, or interrupts the player's fusion with the machine; consoles ""mold to the player's natural posture,"" eliminating the distance between the player's body and frictionless touch screens: *""Every feature of a slot machine---its mathematical structure, visual graphics, sound dynamics, seating and screen ergonomics---is calibrated to increase a gambler's 'time on device' and to encourage 'play to extinction.'""* The aim is a kind of crazed machine sex, an intimate closed-loop architecture of obsession, loss of self, and auto-gratification.

593|7|25|"Adolescence was officially ""discovered"" in the United States in 1904 by G. Stanley Hall, and even then, Hall, the first doctor of psychology in the country, located the challenges of youth in the rapidly changing context of ""our urbanized hothouse life that tends to ripen everything before its time."" While writing about teenagers in 1904, he observed that adolescence is a period of extreme orientation toward the peer group: ""Some seem for a time to have no resource in themselves, but to be abjectly dependent for their happiness upon their mates."" He also pointed to the potential for cruelty within the peer group, a phenomenon that contemporary psychologists refer to as ""relational aggression."" Decades later, the central challenge of adolescence was famously characterized as ""identity formation"" by the developmental psychologist Erik Erikson, who did much to explain twentieth-century adolescence. Erikson emphasized the adolescent struggle to construct a coherent identity from the mutual ""joinedness"" of the adolescent clique. He described the ""normative crisis"" when fundamental questions of ""right"" and ""wrong"" require inner resources associated with ""introspection"" and ""personal experimentation.""

Many have settled on the notion of ""emerging adulthood"" to denote the years between eighteen and the late twenties as a new life stage: emerging adulthood is to the twenty-first century what adolescence was to the twentieth. And although contemporary researchers embrace a diverse range of methods and paradigms, most concur that the essential challenge of emerging adulthood is the differentiation of a ""self"" from the ""others."""|Chap 7, Para 26|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
595|7|27|"[]There is a broad consensus that our extended life spans often require us to revisit the core questions of identity more than once during our lives, but researchers agree that psychological success during emerging adulthood depends on at least some resolution of identity issues as the basis for the shift toward full adulthood. As one research scholar writes, ""A prime challenge of emerging adulthood is to become the author of your own life."" Who among us does not recognize that call? This existential challenge is enduring, a source of continuity that links generations. What *has* changed are the circumstances in which young people today must meet this challenge."|Chap 7, Para 27|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
596|7|28|"Emerging adulthood is ""ground zero"" in the struggle for the ""relational autonomy"" that prepares young people for the transition into adulthood, as Notre Dame psychologists Daniel Lapsley and Ryan Woodbury characterize it. By ""relational autonomy,"" they mean to underscore the idea that autonomy is not a simplistic cliché of ""individualism,"" unencumbered by attachment or empathy, but instead it strikes a vital balance between the cultivation of inner resources and the capacity for intimacy and relationship. Emerging adulthood requires ""hard bargaining"" to establish a self that is separate from but still connected to others, and the quality of this inner bargain ""gives emerging adulthood a sense of anticipation and urgency,"" aiding a successful transition to adulthood."|Chap 7, Para 28|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
597|7|29|"Even with these insights, it remains difficult to fully grasp the felt experiences of young people who, as Hall aptly described more than a century ago, ""seem... to have no resources in themselves."" Perhaps the most difficult quality to capture is that in this period that precedes the hard bargaining, an ""inner"" sense of ""self"" simply does not yet exist. It is a time when ""I"" *am* whatever the ""others"" think of me, and how ""I"" *feel* is a function of how the ""others"" treat me. Instead of a stable sense of identity, there is only a chameleon that reinvents itself depending upon the social mirror into which it is drawn. In this condition, the ""others"" are not individuals but the audience for whom I perform. Who ""I"" am depends upon the audience. This state of existence in the mirror is pure ""fusion,"" and it captures the meaning of a thirteen-year-old []girl anxiously awaiting the appearance of the little notification box as a sign of her existence and her worth. The young person who has not yet carved out an inward space exists for herself only in the viewpoint of the Other-One. Without the ""others,"" the lights go out.

598|7|30|"In this most elemental sense, the young person who feels compelled to use social media is more truly and accurately described as *hanging on for dear life,* alive in the gaze of others because it's the only life one has, even when it hurts. As developmental psychologist Robert Kegan described the adolescent experience long before the advent of Facebook, ""There *is* no self independent of the context of 'other people liking.'"" This is not a moral or emotional shortcoming but a fact of life in this developmental moment, and it entails certain predictable consequences. For example, one tends to operate through social comparison. One can be easy prey to manipulation, with few defenses against social pressure and other forms of social influence. The fixed belief system of an established group can all too easily fill the inner void, substituting an externally sourced identity for the work of self-construction."|Chap 7, Para 30|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
599|7|31|"Moving on from ""fusion"" means a transition from being someone who *is* their relationships to someone who *has* their relationships. It entails a deep reconfiguration of how we make sense of our experience. In Kegan's language, this means a shift away from a ""culture of mutuality"" to a more complex ""culture of identity, self-authorship, and personal autonomy."" This shift depends upon encountering people and life experiences that demand something more than our reflection in the mirror. It requires individuals and situations that insist on our first-person voice, provoking us to carve out our own unique response to the world."|Chap 7, Para 31|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
600|7|32|"This is an inner act that eludes rendition or datafication as we begin to compose an inward sense of valid truth and moral authority.

It can reflect on itself, know itself, and regulate itself with intentional choices and purposive action. Research shows that these big leaps in self-construction are stimulated by experiences such as structured reflection, conflict, dissonance, crisis, and failure. The people who help trigger this new inward connection refuse to act as our mirrors. They reject fusion in favor of genuine reciprocity.

Clinical studies identify specific patterns associated with this developmental stagnation.

Loss of the mirror is the felt equivalent of extinction.|Chap 7, Para 33|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
602|7|34|The cultivation of inner resources is thus critical to the capacity for intimacy and relationship, challenges that have become more time-consuming with each new phase of the modern era.

603|7|35|First, the waning of traditional society and the evolution of social complexity have accelerated the processes of individualization.

604|7|36|Second, digital connection has become a necessary means of social participation, in part because of a widespread institutional failure to adapt to the needs of a new society of individuals.

605|7|37|"Third, surveillance capitalism dominates and instrumentalizes digital connection. ""What is different as a result of social media,"" writes researcher danah boyd in her examination of the social lives of networked teens, ""is that teens' perennial desire for social connection and autonomy is now being expressed in *networked publics.*"" It's true that for the sake of connection, the travails of identity are visible to a wider group. But the notion of ""networked publics"" is a paradox. In fact, our visibility is magnified and compelled not only by the public-ness of networked spaces but by the fact that []they are privatized. Young life now unfolds in the spaces of private capital, owned and operated by surveillance capitalists, mediated by their ""economic orientation,"" and operationalized in practices designed to maximize surveillance revenues. These private spaces are the media through which every form of social influence---social pressure, social comparison, modeling, subliminal priming---is summoned to tune, herd, and manipulate behavior in the name of surveillance revenues.

There are chat groups and endless query threads as people try to divine what Facebook actually does. Relevant design practices are discussed in journalistic accounts as well as in books with such titles as *Evil by Design, Hooked,* and *Irresistible,* all of which help to normalize the very methods they discuss. For example, *Evil by Design* author Chris Nodder, a user-experience consultant, explains that evil design aims to exploit human weakness by creating interfaces that ""make users emotionally involved in doing something that benefits the designer more than them.""

Facebook relies on specific practices that feed the inclinations of people, especially young people, to know themselves from ""the outside looking in."" Most critical is that the more the need for the ""others"" is fed, the less able one is to engage the work of self-construction.

609|7|41|"Facebook's single most momentous innovation in behavioral engineering is the now equally ubiquitous ""Like"" button, adopted in 2009. According to contemporaneous blog posts by longtime Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, the ""Like"" button had been debated internally for more than a year and a half before Zuckerberg's final decision to incorporate it. He had rejected the idea more than once, fearing that it would detract from other features intended to lift monetization, such as the controversial Beacon program. Significantly, the founder embraced the button only when new data revealed it as a powerful source of behavioral surplus that helped to ratchet up the magnetism of the Facebook News Feed, as measured by the volume of comments."|Chap 7, Para 41|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
610|7|42|"Facebook's leadership appears to have realized only gradually that the button could transform the platform from a book into a blizzard of mirrors, a passive read into an active sea of mutual reflections that would glue users to their news feeds.

611|7|43|"The protocols at Instagram, a Facebook property, provide another good example of these processes. Here one sees these tight linkages as compulsion draws more surplus to feed more compulsion. Instagram rivets its users with photos that appeal to their interests, so how does it select those photos from the millions that are available? The obvious, but incorrect, answer would be that it analyzes the contents of photos that you like and shows you more. Instead, Instagram's analytics are drawn from behavioral surplus: the shadow text. As one manager describes it, ""You base predictions off an action, and then you do stuff around that action."" Actions are signals like ""following,"" ""liking,"" and ""sharing,"" now and in the past. The circle widens from there. []With whom did you share? Who do they follow, like, and share with? ""Instagram is mining the multilayered social web between users,"" but that mining is based on observable, measurable behaviors moving through time: the dynamic surplus of the shadow text drawn from its own caches as well as Facebook's, not the content displayed in the public text.

A post with zero likes wasn't just privately painful, but also a kind of public condemnation."" In fact, most users craved the reward more than they feared humiliation, and the ""Like"" button became Facebook's signature, spreading across the digital universe and actively fusing users in a new kind of mutual dependency expressed in a pastel orgy of giving and receiving reinforcement."|Chap 7, Para 44|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
613|7|45|"The ""Like"" button was only the start of what was to be an historic construction of a new social world that for many users is defined by fusion with the social mirror, especially among the young.

""No one was prepared for their online activity to suddenly be fodder for mass consumption,"" recalled the tech news site *TechCrunch* on News Feed's tenth anniversary in 2016, as it offered readers ""The Ultimate Guide to the News Feed,"" with instructions on ""how you can get your content seen by more people,"" how to appear ""prominently,"" and how to resonate with your ""audience.""

Although these vulnerabilities run deepest among the young, the tendency to over-share is not restricted to them. The difficulty of self-imposed discipline in the sharing of private thoughts, feelings, and other personal information has been amply demonstrated in social research and summarized in an important 2015 review by Carnegie Mellon professors Alessandro Acquisti, Laura Brandimarte, and George Loewenstein. They concluded that because of a range of psychological and contextual factors, ""People are often unaware of the information they are sharing, unaware of how it can be used, and even in the rare situations when they have full knowledge of the consequences of sharing, uncertain about their own preferences...."" The researchers cautioned that people are ""easily influenced in what and how much they disclose. Moreover, what they share can be used to influence their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors....""

Researchers are already providing answers to two key questions: What are the psychological processes that dominate the hive? What are the individual and societal consequences of these processes? According to the 302 most significant quantitative research studies on the relationships between social media use and mental health (most of them produced since 2013), the psychological process that most defines the Facebook experience is what psychologists call ""social comparison."" It is usually considered a natural and virtually automatic process that operates outside of awareness, ""effectively forced upon the individual by his social environment"" as we apply evaluative criteria tacitly internalized from our society, community, group, family, and friends. As one research review summarizes, ""Almost at the moment of exposure, an initial holistic assessment of the similarity between the target and the self is made."" As we go through life being exposed to other people, we naturally compare ourselves along the lines of similarity and contrast---*I am like you. I am different from you*---subliminal perceptions that translate into judgments---*I am better than you. You are better than I.*"|Chap 7, Para 55|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
624|7|56|"[]Researchers have come to appreciate the way in which these automatic human processes converge with the changing conditions of each historical era. For most of human history, people lived in small enclaves and were typically surrounded by others very much like themselves. Social comparisons with little variation are unlikely to entail great psychological risk. Research suggests that the diffusion of television in the second half of the twentieth century dramatically increased the intensity and negativity of social comparison, as it brought vivid evidence of varied and more-affluent lives dramatically different from one's own. One study found an increase in criminal larceny as television diffused across society, awakening an awareness of and desire for consumer goods. A related issue was that increased exposure to television programs depicting affluence led to ""the overestimation of others' wealth and more dissatisfaction with one's own life."""|Chap 7, Para 56|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
625|7|57|"Social media marks a new era in the intensity, density, and pervasiveness of social comparison processes, especially for the youngest among us, who are ""almost constantly online"" at a time of life when one's own identity, voice, and moral agency are a work in progress.

If television created more life dissatisfaction, what happens in the infinite spaces of social media?"|Chap 7, Para 57|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
626|7|58|"Both television and social media deprive us of real-life encounters, in which we sense the other's inwardness and share something of our own, thus establishing some threads of communality. Unlike television, however, social media entails active self-presentation characterized by ""profile inflation,"" in which biographical information, photos, and updates are crafted to appear ever more marvelous in anticipation of the stakes for popularity, self-worth, and happiness. Profile inflation triggers more negative self-evaluation among individuals as people compare themselves to others, which then leads to more profile inflation, especially among larger networks that include more ""distant friends."" As one study concluded, ""Expanding one's social network by adding a number of distant friends through Facebook may be detrimental by stimulating negative emotions for users."""|Chap 7, Para 58|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
627|7|59|"One consequence of the new density of social comparison triggers and their negative feedback loops is a psychological condition known as FOMO (""fear of missing out""). It is a form of social anxiety defined as ""the uneasy []and sometimes all-consuming feeling that... your peers are doing, in the know about, or in possession of more or something better than you."" It's a young person's affliction that is associated with negative mood and low levels of life satisfaction. Research has identified FOMO with compulsive Facebook use: FOMO sufferers obsessively checked their Facebook feeds---during meals, while driving, immediately upon waking or before sleeping, and so on. This compulsive behavior is intended to produce relief in the form of social reassurance, but it predictably breeds more anxiety and more searching."|Chap 7, Para 59|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA

629|7|61|"What do we know about the mental health consequences of social comparison as it ensnares Facebook users, especially the young? Most of the research aimed at a deeper grasp of cause and effect in the user experience has been conducted with college-age participants, and even a brief review of a few key studies tells a grim tale, as adolescents and emerging adults run naked through these digitally mediated social territories in search of proof of life. A 2011 study found that social media users exposed to pictures of ""beautiful users"" developed a more negative self-image than those who were shown less attractive profile pictures. Men who were shown profiles of high-career-status men judged their own pursuits as inadequate, compared to others who saw profiles of less successful men. By 2013, researchers found that Facebook use could predict negative shifts in both how their young subjects felt moment to moment as well as their overall life satisfaction. That year, German researchers found that the ""astounding... wealth of social information"" presented on Facebook produces ""a basis for social comparison and envy on an unprecedented scale."" Their work demonstrated that ""passive following"" on Facebook exacerbates feelings of envy and decreases life satisfaction. More than 20 percent of all recent experiences of envy reported by the students in the research study had been triggered by Facebook exposure."|Chap 7, Para 61|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
630|7|62|[]A three-phase investigation in 2014 found that spending a lot of time browsing profiles on Facebook produced a negative mood immediately afterward. Then, upon reflection, those users felt worse, reckoning that they had wasted their time. Instead of walking away, they typically chose to spend even more time browsing the network in the hope of feeling better, chasing the dream of a sudden and magical reversal of fortune that would justify past suffering. This cycle not only leads to more social comparison and more envy, but it can also predict depressive symptoms.|Chap 7, Para 62|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
631|7|63|"The self-objectification associated with social comparison is also associated with other psychological dangers. First we present ourselves as data objects for inspection, and then we experience ourselves as the ""it"" that others see.

An analysis of young men and women who had used Facebook for at least six years concluded that, regardless of gender, more Facebook participation leads to more body surveillance. A sense of self-worth comes to depend on physical appearance and being perceived as a sex object.

Both are substitutes for the ""hard bargain"" of carving out a self that is capable of reciprocity rather than fusion.

This approach enabled ongoing direct comparisons between real-world relationships and Facebook associations across four domains of self-reported well-being: physical health, mental []health, life satisfaction, and body mass index. ""Liking others' content and clicking links to posts by friends,"" the researchers summarized, ""were consistently related to compromised well-being, whereas the number of status updates was related to reports of diminished mental health."" So strong was this relationship that ""a 1-standard-deviation increase in 'likes clicked'... 'links clicked'... or 'status updates' was associated with a decrease of 5%--8% of a standard deviation in self-reported mental health,"" even controlling for a person's initial state of well-being.

In the confrontation with human predators, however, this instinct has proven fatal."|Chap 7, Para 71|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA

Commercial harvesters followed the pigeons' flight and nesting patterns, and then used huge nets to catch thousands of pigeons at a time, shipping millions by rail each year to the markets from St. Louis to Boston. The harvesters used a specific technique, designed to exploit the extraordinary bonds of empathy among the birds and immortalized in the term ""stool pigeon."" A few birds would be captured first and attached to a perch with their eyes sewn shut. As these birds fluttered in panic, the flock would descend to ""attend to them."" This made it easy for the harvesters to ""catch and slaughter"" thousands at once. The last passenger pigeon died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1914: ""The pigeon had no home boundaries over which to spread itself and continued to orient only to itself, so it could be everywhere, even to the end....

Facebook's applied utopistics are a prototype of an instrumentarian future, showcasing feats of behavioral engineering that groom populations for the rigors of instrumentarianism's coercive harmonies.

656|7|88|:::  The difference is that Goffman assumed a backstage where you could be your true self. For us, the backstage is shrinking. There is almost no place left where I can be my true self. Even when I am walking by myself, and I think I am backstage, something happens---an ad appears on my phone or someone takes a photo, and, I discover that I am onstage, and everything changes. :::|Chap 7, Para 88|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
657|7|89|"The ""everything"" that changes is the sudden cognizance, part realization and part reminder, that Big Other knows no boundaries. Experience is seamlessly rendered across the once-reliable borders of the virtual and real worlds. This accrues to the immediate benefit of surveillance capital---""Welcome to McDonald's!"" ""Buy this jacket!""---but any worldly experience can just as immediately be delivered to the hive: a post here, a photo there. Ubiquitous connection means that the audience is never far, and this fact brings all the pressures of the hive into the world and the body."|Chap 7, Para 89|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA

The researchers conclude that participation in social media ""is profoundly intertwined with the knowledge that information about our offline activities may be communicated online, and that the thought of displeasing 'imagined audiences' alters our 'real-life' behavior."""|Chap 7, Para 90|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
659|7|91|"When I catch myself wanting to cheer the students who are anguished by connection and terrified of its loss, I consider the meaning of ""no exit"" []as recounted in a personal recollection of the social psychologist Stanley Milgram regarding an experiment that demonstrated ""the power of immediate circumstances on feelings and behavior."""|Chap 7, Para 91|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
660|7|92|"Milgram's class was studying the force with which social norms control behavior. He had the idea of examining the real-life phenomenon by having his students approach a person on the subway and, without providing any justification, simply look the person in the eye and ask for his or her seat. One afternoon, Milgram himself boarded the subway ready to make his contribution. Despite his years of observing and theorizing disturbing patterns of human behavior, it turned out that he was unprepared for his own moment of social confrontation. Assuming that it would be an ""easy"" caper, Milgram approached a passenger and was about to utter the ""magical phrase"" when ""the words seemed lodged in my trachea and would simply not emerge. I stood there frozen, then retreated... I was overwhelmed by paralyzing inhibition."" The psychologist eventually hectored himself into trying again. He recounts what occurred when he finally approached a passenger and ""choked out"" his request:"|Chap 7, Para 92|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
661|7|93|":::  ""Excuse me, sir, may I have your seat?"" A moment of stark anomic panic overcame me. But the man got right up and gave me the seat.... Taking the man's seat, I was overwhelmed by the need to behave in a way that would justify my request. My head sank between my knees, and I could feel my face blanching. I was not role-playing. I actually felt as if I were going to perish. :::"|Chap 7, Para 93|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
662|7|94|"Moments later the train pulled into the next station, and Milgram exited. He was surprised to discover that as soon as he left the train, ""all the tension disappeared."" Milgram left the subway, where he vibrated in tune with the ""others,"" and that exit enabled a return to his ""self."""|Chap 7, Para 94|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
663|7|95|"Milgram identified three key themes in the subway experiment as he and his students debriefed their experiences. The first was a new sense of gravitas toward ""the enormous inhibitory anxiety that ordinarily prevents us from breaching social norms."" Second was that the reactions of the ""breacher"" are not an expression of individual personality but rather are ""a compelled playing out of the logic of social relations."" The intense ""anxiety"" that Milgram []and others experienced in confronting a social norm ""forms a powerful barrier that must be surmounted, whether one's action is consequential---disobeying an authority---or trivial, asking for a seat on the subway.... Embarrassment and the fear of violating apparently trivial norms often lock us into intolerable predicaments.... These are not minor regulatory forces in social life, but basic ones."""|Chap 7, Para 95|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
664|7|96|"Finally, Milgram understood that any confrontation of social norms crucially depends upon the ability to escape. It was not an adolescent who boarded the subway that day. Milgram was an erudite adult and an expert on human behavior, especially the mechanisms entailed in obedience to authority, social influence, and conformity. The subway was just an ordinary slice of life, not a capital-intensive architecture of surveillance and behavior modification, not a ""personalized reward device."" Still, Milgram could not fight off the anxiety of the situation. The only thing that made it tolerable was the possibility of an exit."|Chap 7, Para 96|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
665|7|97|"Unlike Milgram, we face an intolerable situation. Like the gamblers in their machine wombs, we are meant to fuse with the system and play to extinction: not the extinction of our funds but rather the extinction of our selves. Extinction is a design feature formalized in the conditions of no exit. The aim of the tuners is to contain us within ""the power of immediate circumstances"" as we are compelled by the ""logic of social relations"" in the hive to bow to social pressure exerted in calculated patterns that exploit our natural empathy. Continuously tightening feedback loops cut off the means of exit, creating impossible levels of anxiety that further drive the loops toward confluence. What is to be killed here is the inner impulse toward autonomy and the arduous, exciting elaboration of the autonomous self as a source of moral judgment and authority capable of asking for a subway seat or standing against rogue power."|Chap 7, Para 97|07 RENDITION: FROM EXPERIENCE TO DATA
666|7|98|Inside the hive, it is easy to forget that every exit is an entrance. To exit the hive means to enter that territory beyond, where one finds refuge from the artificially tuned-up social pressure of the others. Exit leaves behind the point of view of the Other-One in favor of entering a space in which one's gaze can finally settle inward. To exit means to enter the place where a self can be birthed and nurtured.

670|8|5|"[]The machine invasion of human depth is prosecuted under the banner of ""personalization,"" a slogan that betrays the zest and cynicism brought to the grimy challenge of exploiting second-modernity needs and insecurities for outsize gain. From the point of view of the prediction imperative, personalization is a means of ""individualizing"" supply operations in order to secure a continuous flow of behavioral surplus from the depths. This process can be accomplished successfully only in the presence of our unrelenting hunger for recognition, appreciation, and most of all, support."|Chap 8, Para 5|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
671|8|6|"Recall that Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, helped chart this course. ""Personalization and customization"" are the third ""new use"" of computer-mediated transactions. Instead of having to ask Google questions, it should ""know what you want and tell you before you ask the question."" Google Now, the corporation's first digital assistant, was charged with this task. Varian warned that people would have to give Google even more of themselves in order to reap the value of the application: ""Google Now has to know a lot about you and your environment to provide these services. This worries some people."" He rationalizes any concern, arguing that rendering personal information to Google is no different from sharing intimacies with doctors, lawyers, and accountants. ""Why am I willing to share all this private information?"" he asks. ""Because I get something in return.... These digital assistants will be so useful that everyone will want one."" Varian is confident that the needs of second-modernity individuals will subvert any resistance to the rendition of personal experience as the quid pro quo for the promise of a less stressful and more effective life."|Chap 8, Para 6|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
672|8|7|In fact, Varian's notion of personalization is the precise opposite of the relationships with trusted professionals to which he refers. Doctors, accountants, and attorneys are held to account by mutual dependencies and reciprocities dictated by the extensive institutionalization of professional education, codes of conduct, and procedures for evaluation and review. Violation of these rules risks punishment in the form of professional sanction and public law. Google and its brethren in surveillance capitalism bear no such risks.|Chap 8, Para 7|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
673|8|8|"Varian's remarks constitute one of those rare occasions in which the fog of technology rhetoric parts just enough to discern the utilities of social and economic inequality to surveillance capitalism's larger mission. Varian reasons that inequality offers an opportunity to raise the ante on Google's quid []pro quo for effective life. He counsels that the way to predict the future is to observe what rich people have because that's also what the middle class and the poor will want. ""What do rich people have now?"" he asks rhetorically. ""Personal assistants."""|Chap 8, Para 8|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
674|8|9|"That the luxuries of one generation or class become the necessities of the next has been fundamental to the evolution of capitalism during the last five hundred years. Historians describe the ""consumer boom"" that ignited the first industrial revolution in late-eighteenth-century Britain, when, thanks to visionaries like Josiah Wedgewood and the innovations of the early modern factory, families new to the middle class began to buy the china, furniture, and textiles that only the rich had previously enjoyed. This new ""propensity to consume"" is considered ""unprecedented in the depth to which it penetrated the lower reaches of society...."" In 1767 the political economist Nathaniel Forster worried that ""fashionable luxury"" was spreading ""like a contagion,"" and he complained of the ""perpetual restless ambition in each of the inferior ranks to raise themselves to the level of those immediately above them."" Adam Smith wrote insightfully on this social process, noting that upper-class luxuries can in time be recast as ""necessaries."" This occurs as ""the established rules of decency"" change to reflect new customs introduced by elites, triggering lower-cost production methods that transform what was once unattainable into newly affordable goods and services. Ford's Model T is the outstanding twentieth-century example of this progression."|Chap 8, Para 9|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
675|8|10|"Varian casts personalization as a twenty-first-century equivalent of these historical dynamics, the new ""necessaries"" for the harried masses bent under the weight of stagnant wages, dual-career obligations, indifferent corporations, and austerity's hollowed-out public institutions. Varian's bet is that the digital assistant will be so vital a resource in the struggle for effective life that ordinary people will accede to its substantial forfeitures. ""There is no putting the genie back in the bottle,"" Varian the inevitabilist insists. ""Everyone will expect to be tracked and monitored, since the advantages, in terms of convenience, safety, and services, will be so great... continuous monitoring will be the norm."" Everyone, that is, except those wealthy or stubborn enough to achieve effective life without Google's assistance and thus escape the worst excesses of rendition.

All of this firepower was amassed in order to learn from your content, context, and behavior not only through search, e-mail, and calendar activity but also from the data in your phone, including movement, location, activities, voice, and apps.

In time, the obsession with voice may be surpassed or joined by others so that merely thinking a thought or waving a finger can translate into and initiate action. For now, there are compelling reasons for the race to the spoken word. The first is obvious: reliable voice recognition can translate a sprawling landscape of service interactions into low-cost automated processes of theoretically unlimited scale and scope, a fact that has been noted by labor economists for some time. The competitive race between a new crop of ""personal digital assistants"" is best understood from this point of view. The voice that rises to dominance, the One Voice, will be the colossus of behavioral surplus pipelines with a potentially insurmountable competitive advantage in its ability to corner and kidnap the dominant share of human experience."|Chap 8, Para 18|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS

The more we fancy the apparatus as our confidante, nanny, governess, and support system---a disembodied, pervasive ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" for each person---the more experience we allow it to render, and the richer its supply operations grow. Communication is the first human joy, and a conversational interface []is prized for the frictionless ease in which a mere utterance can trigger action, especially market action: ""Let there be light."" ""Let there be new running shoes."" What could be dreamier than to speak and have it be so? An Amazon senior vice president comments on the company's voice-activated home devices: ""The nice thing about the Amazon device business is that when we sell a device, generally people buy more blue jeans.

The speaker feels herself at the center of a seamlessly flowing universe. The seams are all backstage, where the machines confront and conquer stubborn sources of friction such as distinct apps and entities; recalcitrant administrative service, distribution, payments, and delivery systems; and boundaries and borders that threaten the flows of desire and satisfaction. Spontaneous and fluid, universally burbling ""conversation"" turns the new personal digital assistant into a voice that sits between your life and the new markets for your life, between your experience and the auctioning of your experience: ""a runtime, a new interface"" that creates the sensation of mastery while, in fact, giving it away."|Chap 8, Para 20|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS

The DIALOG platform created a new social space in which the scientific community at Drug Corp elaborated and extended ""their networks of relationships, access to information, thoughtful dialogue, and social banter,"" as I described it then. They embraced DIALOG with great enthusiasm, but it did not end well. ""In time,"" I wrote, ""it became clear that they had also unwittingly exposed once evanescent and intangible aspects of their social exchange to an unprecedented degree of hierarchical scrutiny.""

In a series of conflicts that unfolded over the years, I watched as the managers and executives at Drug Corp were simply unable to quell their inclination to use the new social text as a means to evaluate, critique, and punish. On more than one occasion I learned of managers who had printed out pages of DIALOG conversations in order to spread them out on the floor and analyze opinions on a particular subject, sometimes actually taking scissors to the pages and organizing the entries by theme or person. In many cases these investigations were pure fact gathering, []but in other instances managers wanted to identify the individuals who agreed with or opposed their directives.|Chap 8, Para 51|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS

723|8|58|"In the course of this research, the team came to appreciate the magic of behavioral surplus, discovering, for example, that a person's disclosure of specific personal information such as religion or political affiliation contributes less to a robust personality analysis than the fact that the individual is willing to share such information in the first place. This insight alerted the team to a new genre of powerful behavioral metrics. Instead of analyzing the content of user lists, such as favorite TV shows, activities, and music, they learned that simple ""meta-data""---such as the *amount* of information shared---""turned out to be much more useful and predictive than the original raw data."" The computations produced on the strength of these behavioral metrics, when combined with automated linguistic analysis and internal Facebook statistics, led the research team to conclude that ""we can predict a user's score for a personality trait to within just more than one-tenth of its actual value."" The University of Maryland team began what would become a multiyear journey toward the instrumentalization of data from the depths for the purposes of a highly intentional program of manipulation and behavioral []modification.

726|8|61|"In the UK a team of researchers, including Cambridge University's Michal Kosinski and the deputy director of Cambridge's Psychometrics Centre, David Stillwell, built on this line of research. Stillwell had already developed the myPersonality database, a ""third-party"" Facebook application that allows users to take psychometric tests, like those based on the five-factor model, and receive feedback on their results. Launched in 2007 and hosted at the Psychometrics Centre, by 2016 the database contained more than six million personality profiles complemented by four million individual Facebook profiles. Once regarded as a unique, if offbeat, source of psychological data, myPersonality had become the database of choice for the scoping, standardization, and validation of the new models capable of *predicting* personality values from ever-smaller samples of Facebook data and meta-data. Later, it would become the model for the work of a small consultancy called Cambridge Analytica, which used the new caches of behavioral surplus for an onslaught of politically inspired behavioral micro-targeting."|Chap 8, Para 61|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
727|8|62|"In a 2012 paper Kosinski and Stillwell concluded that ""user personality can be easily and effectively predicted from public data"" and warned that []social media users are dangerously unaware of the vulnerabilities that follow their innocent but voluminous personal disclosures. Their discussion specifically cited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's unilateral upending of established privacy norms in 2010, when he famously announced that Facebook users no longer have an expectation of privacy. Zuckerberg had described the corporation's decision to unilaterally release users' personal information, declaring, ""We decided that these would be the social norms now, and we just went for it."""|Chap 8, Para 62|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS

729|8|64|"The authors appeared increasingly ambivalent about the social implications of their work. On the one hand, they announced that these new predictive capabilities could be used to ""improve numerous products and services."" They concluded that online businesses can adjust their behavior to match each user's personality, with marketing and product recommendations psychologically tailored to each individual. But the authors also warned that automated prediction engines run by companies, governments, or Facebook itself can compute millions of profiles without individual consent or awareness, discovering facts ""that an individual may not have intended to share."" The researchers cautioned that ""one can imagine situations in which such predictions, even if incorrect, could pose a threat to an individual's well-being, freedom, or even life."""|Chap 8, Para 64|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS

The study made clear that the real breakthrough of the Facebook prediction research was the achievement of economies in the exploitation of these most-intimate behavioral depths with ""automated, accurate, and cheap personality assessment tools"" that effectively target a new class of ""objects"" once known as your ""personality.""

This is not easily faked because the surplus retrieved for analysis is necessarily opaque to us. We are not scrutinized for substance but for form. The price you are offered does not derive from *what* you write about but *how* you write it. It is not what is in your sentences but in their length and complexity, not *what* you list but *that* you list, not the picture but the choice of filter and degree of saturation, not *what* you disclose but how you share or fail to, not *where* you make plans to see your friends but *how* you do so: a casual ""later"" or a precise time and place?

733|8|68|"That the ""personality"" insights themselves are banal should not distract us from the fact that the volume and depth of the new surplus supplies enabled by these extraction operations are unprecedented; nothing like this has ever been conceivable. As Kosinski told an interviewer in 2015, few people []understand that companies such as ""Facebook, Snapchat, Microsoft, Google and others have access to data that scientists would not ever be able to collect."" Data scientists have successfully predicted traits on the five-factor personality model with surplus culled from Twitter profile pictures (color, composition, image type, demographic information, facial presentation, and expression...), selfies (color, photographic styles, visual texture...), and Instagram photos (hue, brightness, saturation...). Others have tested alternative algorithmic models and personality constructs. Another research team demonstrated the ability to predict ""satisfaction with life"" from Facebook messages.

Recognizing the woefully asymmetric division of learning, he lamented the refusals of Facebook and the other internet firms to share their data with the ""general public,"" concluding that ""it's not because they're evil, but because the general public is bloody stupid... as a society we lost the ability to convince large companies that have enormous budgets and enormous access to data to share this goodness with us....

It did not take long. By early 2015, IBM announced that its Watson Personality Service was open for business.

[]It then identifies ""values,"" defined as ""motivating factors which influence a person's decision-making across five dimensions: Self-transcendence/Helping others, Conservation/Tradition, Hedonism/Taking pleasure in life, Self-enhancement/Achieving success, and Open to change/Excitement."""|Chap 8, Para 70|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
736|8|71|"IBM promises ""limitless"" applications of its new surplus supplies and ""deeper portraits of individual customers."" As we would expect, these operations are tested among captive employees who, once habituated, can become docile members of a behaviorally purified society.

The corporation says that ""social media content and behavior"" can be used to ""capitalize on targeted revenue-generating opportunities"" with ""mapping rules from personality to behavior."" The messaging and approach of customer service agents, insurance agents, travel agents, real estate agents, investment brokers, and so on can be ""matched"" to the ""personality"" of the customer, with those psychological data displayed to the agent at the precise moment of contact. IBM's research demonstrates that agents who express personality traits associated with ""agreeableness"" and ""conscientiousness"" produce significantly higher levels of customer satisfaction.

In a Twitter targeted-ad experiment, IBM found that it could significantly increase click-through rates and ""follow"" rates by targeting individuals with high ""openness"" and low ""neuroticism"" scores on the five-factor personality analysis. In another study, IBM rendered behavioral data from 2,000 Twitter users to establish metrics such as response rates, activity levels, and elapsed time between tweets, in addition to psycholinguistic analyses of tweets and five-factor personality analysis. IBM ""trained"" its predictive model by asking the 2,000 users either location-related or product-related questions. The findings showed that personality information predicted the likelihood of responses. People whom the machines rated as moral, trusting, friendly, extroverted, and agreeable tended to respond, compared to low response rates []from people rated as cautious and anxious. Many of the characteristics that we try to teach our children and model in our own behavior are simply repurposed as dispossession opportunities for hidden machine processes of rendition.

Indeed, the confidential document cites some of the key raw materials fed into this high-velocity, high-volume, and deeply scoped manufacturing operation, including not only location, Wi-Fi network details, and device information but also data from videos, analyses of affinities, details of friendships, and similarities with friends."|Chap 8, Para 77|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
743|8|78|It was probably no coincidence that the leaked Facebook presentation appeared around the same time that a young Cambridge Analytica mastermind-turned-whistleblower, Chris Wylie, unleashed a torrent of information on that company's secret efforts to predict and influence individual voting behavior, quickly riveting the world on the small political analytics []firm and the giant source of its data: Facebook. There are many unanswered questions about the legality of Cambridge Analytica's complex subterfuge, its actual political impact, and its relationship with Facebook. Our interest here is restricted to how its machinations shine a bright light on the power of surveillance capitalism's mechanisms, especially the determination to render data from the depth dimension.|Chap 8, Para 78|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
744|8|79|"Kosinski and Stillwell had called attention to the commercial value of their methods, understanding that surplus from the depths afforded new possibilities for behavioral manipulation and modification. Wylie recounts his fascination with this prospect, and, through a complicated chain of events, it was he who persuaded Cambridge Analytica to use Kosinski and Stillwell's data to advance its owner's political aims. The objective was ""behavioral micro-targeting... influencing voters based not on their demographics but on their personalities...."" When negotiations with Kosinski and Stillwell broke down, a third Cambridge academic, Alexander Kogan, was hired to render a similar cache of Facebook personality data."|Chap 8, Para 79|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
745|8|80|"Kogan was well-known to Facebook. He had collaborated with its data scientists on a 2013 project in which the company provided data on 57 billion ""friendships."" This time, he paid approximately 270,000 people to take a personality quiz. Unknown to these participants, Kogan's app enabled him to access their Facebook profiles and, on average, the profiles of about 160 of each of the test takers' friends, ""none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect"" this invasion. It was a massive rendition operation from which Kogan successfully produced psychological profiles of somewhere between 50 and 87 million Facebook users, data that he then sold to Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook questioned him about his application, Kogan vowed that his research was solely for academic purposes. Indeed, mutual respect between the two parties was sufficiently robust that Facebook hired one of Kogan's assistants to join its in-house team of research psychologists."|Chap 8, Para 80|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
746|8|81|"""We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles,"" Wylie admitted, ""and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons."" His summary of Cambridge Analytica's accomplishments is a précis of the surveillance capitalist project and a rationale for its determination to render from the depths. These are the very capabilities that have gathered force over the nearly two decades of surveillance capitalism's incubation in []lawless space. These practices produced outrage around the world, when in fact they are routine elements in the daily elaboration of surveillance capitalism's methods and goals, both at Facebook and within other surveillance capitalist companies. Cambridge Analytica merely reoriented the surveillance capitalist machinery from commercial markets in behavioral futures toward guaranteed outcomes in the political sphere. It was Eric Schmidt, not Wylie, who first pried open this Pandora's box, paving the way for the transfer of surveillance capitalism's core mechanisms to the electoral process as he cemented the mutual affinities that produced surveillance exceptionalism. In fact, Wylie enjoyed his early training under Obama's ""director of targeting."" Schmidt's now-weaponized innovations have become the envy of every political campaign and, more dangerously, of every enemy of democracy."|Chap 8, Para 81|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
747|8|82|"In addition to employing surveillance capitalism's foundational mechanisms---rendition, behavioral surplus, machine intelligence, prediction products, economies of scale, scope, and action---Cambridge Analytica's dark adventure also exemplifies surveillance capitalism's tactical requirements. Its operations were designed to produce ignorance through secrecy and the careful evasion of individual awareness. Wylie calls this ""information warfare,"" correctly acknowledging the asymmetries of knowledge and power that are essential to the means of behavioral modification:"|Chap 8, Para 82|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
748|8|83|:::  I think it's worse than bullying, because people don't necessarily know it's being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know... if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you're doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy. :::|Chap 8, Para 83|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
749|8|84|"This ""warfare"" and its structure of invasion and conquest represent surveillance capitalism's standard operating procedures to which billions of innocents are subjected each day, as rendition operations violate all boundaries and modification operations claim dominion over all people. Surveillance capitalism imposes this quid pro quo of ""agency"" as the price of information and connection, continuously pushing the envelope of rendition to new frontiers. Along the way, companies such as Facebook and Google []employ every useful foot soldier, including social scientists such as Kogan who are willing to put their shoulders to the wheel as they help the company learn, perfect, and integrate the cutting-edge methods that can conquer the next frontier, a phenomenon that we will visit in more depth in [Chapter 10](chapter015.xhtml)."|Chap 8, Para 84|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
750|8|85|"Irrespective of Cambridge Analytica's actual competence and its ultimate political impact, the plotting and planning behind its ambitions are testament to the pivotal role of rendition from the depths in the prediction and modification of behavior, always in pursuit of certainty. Billionaires such as Zuckerberg and Mercer have discovered that they can muscle their way to dominance of the division of learning in society by setting their sights on these rendition operations and the fortunes they tell. They aim to be unchallenged in their power to know, to decide who knows, and to decide who decides. The rendition of ""personality"" was an important milestone in this quest: a frontier, yes, but not the final frontier."|Chap 8, Para 85|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS

The aim was ""to develop automated technology that will be able to read a person's emotion when they view content and then establish how this relates to how much they liked the content."" The director of video at AOL International called the project ""a huge leap forward in video ad tech"" and ""the Holy Grail of video marketing.""

752|8|87|"The SEWA project is a window on a burgeoning new domain of rendition and behavioral surplus supply operations known as ""affective computing,"" ""emotion analytics,"" and ""sentiment analysis."" The personalization project descends deeper toward the ocean floor with these new tools, where they lay claim to yet a new frontier of rendition trained not only on your personality but also on your emotional life. If this project of surplus from the depths is to succeed, then your unconscious---where feelings form before there are words []to express them---must be recast as simply one more source of raw-material supply for machine rendition and analysis, all of it for the sake of more-perfect prediction.

This complex of machine intelligence is trained to isolate, capture, and render the most subtle and intimate behaviors, from an inadvertent blink to a jaw that slackens in surprise for a fraction of a second. Combinations of sensors and software can recognize and identify faces; estimate age, ethnicity, and gender; analyze gaze direction and blinks; and track distinct facial points to interpret ""micro-expressions,"" eye movements, emotions, moods, stress, deceit, boredom, confusion, intentions, and more: all at the speed of life. As the SEWA project description says,"|Chap 8, Para 88|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
754|8|89|:::  Technologies that can robustly and accurately analyse human facial, vocal and verbal behaviour and interactions in the wild, as observed by omnipresent webcams in digital devices, would have profound impact on indicators that heretofore resisted measurement because they were too subtle or fleeting to be measured by the human eye and ear....  :::|Chap 8, Para 89|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
755|8|90|"These behaviors also elude the conscious mind. The machines capture the nanosecond of disgust that precedes a rapid-fire sequence of anger, comprehension, and finally joy on the face of a young woman watching a few frames of film, when all she can think to say is ""I liked it!"" A Realeyes white paper explains that its webcams record people watching videos in their homes ""so we can capture genuine reactions."" Algorithms process facial expressions, and ""emotions are detected, aggregated, and reported online in real time, second by second... enabling our clients to make better business decisions.""

Realeyes says that its data sets contain over 5.5 million individually annotated frames of more than 7,000 subjects from all over the world: ""We are continuously working to build the world's largest expression and behaviour datasets by increasing the quality and volume of our already-existing categories, and by creating new sets---for other expressions, emotions, different behavioral clues or different intensities.... Having automated this process, it can then be scaled up to simultaneously track the emotions of entire audiences."" Clients are advised to ""play your audience emotions to stay on top of the game."" The company's website offers a brief review of the history of research on human emotions, concluding that ""the more people feel, the more they spend....

Indeed, these ""nonconscious tools"" extract rarified new qualities of behavioral surplus from your inner life in order to predict what you will buy and the precise moment at which you are most vulnerable to a push. SEWA's advisory chair says that emotional analytics are ""like identifying individual musical notes."" Each potential customer, then, is a brief and knowable composition: ""We will be able to identify chords of human response such as 'liking,' boredom, etc.... We will ultimately become masters of reading each other's feelings and intent."""|Chap 8, Para 92|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
758|8|93|This is not the first time that the unconscious mind has been targeted as an instrument of others' aims. Propaganda and advertising have always been designed to appeal to unacknowledged fears and yearnings. These have relied more on art than science, using gross data or professional intuition for the purpose of mass communication. Those operations cannot be compared to the scientific application of today's historic computational power to the micro-measured, continuous rendition of your more-or-less actual feelings. The new toolmakers do not intend to rob you of your inner life, only to []surveil and exploit it. All they ask is to know more about you than you know about yourself.|Chap 8, Para 93|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
759|8|94|"Although the treasures of the unconscious mind have been construed differently across the millennia---from spirit to soul to self---the ancient priest and the modern psychotherapist are united in an age-old reverence for its primal healing power through self-discovery, self-mastery, integration, restoration, and transcendence. In contrast, the conception of emotions as observable behavioral data first took root in the mid-1960s with the work of Paul Ekman, then a young professor at the University of California, San Francisco. From his earliest papers, Ekman argued that ""actions speak louder than words."" Even when a person is determined to censor or control his or her emotional communications, Ekman postulated that some types of nonverbal behaviors ""escape control and provide leakage."" Early on, he recognized the potential utility of a ""categorical scheme"" that reliably traced the effects of expression back to their causes in emotion, and in 1978 Ekman, along with frequent collaborator Wallace Friesen, published the seminal Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which provided that scheme."|Chap 8, Para 94|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
760|8|95|"FACS distinguishes the elemental movements of facial muscles, breaking them down into twenty-seven facial ""action units,"" along with more for the head, eyes, tongue, and so on. Later, Ekman concluded that six ""basic emotions"" (anger, fear, sadness, enjoyment, disgust, and surprise) anchored the wider array of human emotional expression. FACS and the six-emotion model became the dominant paradigm for the study of facial expression and emotion, in much the same way that the five-factor model came to dominate studies of personality."|Chap 8, Para 95|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
761|8|96|"The program of emotional rendition began innocently enough with MIT Media Lab professor Rosalind Picard and the new field of computer science that she called ""affective computing."" She was among the first to recognize the opportunity for a computational system to automate the analysis of Ekman's facial configurations and correlate micro-expressions with their emotional causality. She aimed to combine facial expression with the computation of vocal intonation and other physiological signals of emotion that could be measured as behavior. In 1997 she published *Affective Computing,* which posited a practical solution to the idea that some emotions are available to the []conscious mind and can be expressed ""cognitively"" (*""I feel scared""*), whereas others may elude consciousness but nevertheless be expressed physically in beads of sweat, a widening of the eyes, or a nearly imperceptible tightening of the jaw."|Chap 8, Para 96|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
762|8|97|"The key to affective computing, Picard argued, was to render both conscious and unconscious emotion as observable behavior for coding and calculation. A computer, she reasoned, would be able to render your emotions as behavioral information. Affect recognition, as she put it, is ""a pattern recognition problem,"" and ""affect expression"" is pattern synthesis. The proposition was that ""computers can be given the ability to recognize emotions as well as a third-person human observer."""|Chap 8, Para 97|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
763|8|98|"Picard imagined her affective insights being put to use in ways that were often good-hearted or, at the very least, benign. Most of the applications she describes conform to the logic of the Aware Home: any knowledge produced would belong to the subject to enhance his or her reflexive learning. For example, she envisioned a ""computer-interviewing agent"" that could function as an ""affective mirror"" coaching a student in preparation for a job interview or a date and an automatic agent that could alert you to hostile tones in your own prose before you press ""send."" Picard anticipated other tools combining software and sensors that she believed could enhance daily life in a range of situations, such as helping autistic children develop emotional skills, providing software designers with feedback on users' frustration levels, assigning points to video game players to reward courage or stress reduction, producing learning modules that stimulate curiosity and minimize anxiety, and analyzing emotional dynamics in a classroom. She imagined software agents that learn your preferences and find you the kinds of news stories, clothing, art, or music that make you smile. Whatever one's reaction to these ideas might be, they share one key pattern: unlike SEWA's model, Picard's data were intended to be *for* you, not merely *about* you."|Chap 8, Para 98|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
764|8|99|"Back in 1997, Picard acknowledged the need for privacy ""so that you remain in control over who gets access to this information."" Importantly for our analysis, in the final pages of her book she expressed some concerns, writing that ""there are good reasons not to broadcast your affective patterns to the world... you might flaunt your good mood in front of friends... you probably do not want it picked up by an army of sales people who are eager []to exploit mood-based buying habits, or by advertisers eager to convince you that you'd feel better if you tried their new soft drink right now."" She noted the possibility of intrusive workplace monitoring, and she voiced reservations about the possibility of a dystopian future in which ""malevolent"" governmental forces use affective computing to manipulate and control the emotions of populations."|Chap 8, Para 99|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
765|8|100|"Despite these few paragraphs of apprehension, her conclusions were bland. Every technology arrives with its ""pros and cons,"" she wrote. The concerns are not ""insurmountable"" because ""safeguards can be developed."" Picard was confident that technologies and techniques could solve any problem, and she imagined ""wearable computers"" that ""gather information strictly for your own use...."" She stressed the importance of ensuring ""that the wearer retains ultimate control over the devices he chooses to wear, so that they are tools of helpful empowerment and not of harmful subjugation."""|Chap 8, Para 100|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
766|8|101|"In a pattern that is by now all too familiar, safeguards lagged as surveillance capitalism flourished. By early 2014, Facebook had already applied for an ""emotion detection"" patent designed to implement each of Picard's fears. The idea was ""one or more software modules capable of detecting emotions, expressions or other characteristic of a user from image information."" As always, the company was ambitious. Its list of detectable emotions ""by way of example and not limitation"" included expressions such as ""a smile, joy, humor, amazement, excitement, surprise, a frown, sadness, disappointment, confusion, jealousy, indifference, boredom, anger, depression, or pain."" The hope was that ""over time"" their module would be able to assess ""a user's interest in displayed content"" for the purposes of ""customization based on emotion type."""|Chap 8, Para 101|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
767|8|102|"By 2017, exactly twenty years after the publication of Picard's book, a leading market research firm forecast that the ""affective computing market,"" including software that recognizes speech, gesture, and facial expressions along with sensors, cameras, storage devices, and processors, would grow from \$9.35 billion in 2015 to \$53.98 billion in 2021, predicting a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 35 percent. What happened to cause this explosion? The report concludes that heading up the list of ""triggers"" for this dramatic growth is ""rising demand for mapping human emotions especially by the marketing and advertising sector...."" Picard's good intentions were []like so many innocent iron filings in the presence of a magnet as the market demand exerted by the prediction imperative drew affective computing into surveillance capitalism's powerful force field."|Chap 8, Para 102|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS
768|8|103|Picard would eventually become part of this new dispossession industry with a company called Affectiva that was cofounded with Rana el Kaliouby, an MIT Media Lab postdoctoral research scientist and Picard protégé.

769|8|104|"Both Picard and Kaliouby had shared a vision of applying their research in medical and therapeutic settings. The challenges of autistic children seemed a perfect fit for their discoveries, so they trained a machine system called MindReader to recognize emotions using paid actors to mimic specific emotional responses and facial gestures. Early on, MIT Media Lab corporate sponsors Pepsi, Microsoft, Bank of America, Nokia, Toyota, Procter and Gamble, Gillette, Unilever, and others had overwhelmed the pair with queries about using their system to measure customers' emotional responses. Kaliouby describes the women's hesitation and their determination to focus on ""do-good"" applications.

After all, those cookies once stirred outrage, and now they inundate every online move. For example, she anticipates YouTube scanning its viewers' emotions as they watch videos. Her confidence is buoyed by demand that originates in the prediction imperative: ""The way I see it, it doesn't matter that your Fitbit doesn't have a camera, because your phone does, and your laptop does, and your TV will. All that data gets fused with biometrics from your wearable devices and builds an emotional profile for you.""

Their expertise disrupts the very notion of the autonomous individual by rewarding ""boundarylessness"" with whatever means are available---offers of elite status, bonuses, happiness points, discounts, ""buy"" buttons pushed to your device at the precise moment predicted for maximum success---so that we might strip and surrender to the pawing and prying of the machines that serve the new market cosmos."|Chap 8, Para 111|08 RENDITION FROM THE DEPTHS

Jean-Paul Sartre writes that ""freedom is nothing but the *existence* of our will,"" and he elaborates: ""Actually it is not enough to will; it is necessary to will to will."" This rising up of *the will to will* is the inner act that secures us as autonomous beings who project choice into the world and exercise the qualities of self-determining moral judgment that are civilization's necessary and final bulwark.

This chapter and the next draw our attention to the gap between experience and data, as well as to the specific operations that target this gap on a mission to transform the one into the other. I call these operations *rendition*. We have seen that the dispossession of human experience is the original sin of surveillance capitalism, but this dispossession is not mere abstraction. *Rendition* describes the concrete operational practices through []which dispossession is accomplished, as human experience is claimed as raw material for datafication and all that follows, from manufacturing to sales. A focus on these intermediate practices illustrates that the apparatus of ubiquity is not a passive one-way mirror. Rather, it actively creates its own stores of knowledge through rendition."|Chap 9, Para 8|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
787|9|9|"The noun *rendition* derives from the verb *render,* a most unusual word whose double meanings describe a two-sided equation that perfectly captures what happens in the gap between human experience and behavioral data. On one side of the equation, the verb describes a process in which something is formed out of something else that is originally given. It designates the causal action of turning one thing into another, such as rendering oil from fat (extraction) or rendering an English text from the original Latin (translation). These meanings have also found their way into the vocabulary of digital technology. For example, a ""rendering engine"" converts the coded content of an HTML page for display and printing."|Chap 9, Para 9|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
788|9|10|"On the other side of the equation, *render* also describes the way in which the thing that is changed gives itself over to this process: it *sur-renders.* The verb *rendre* first appears in tenth-century French, meaning ""to give back, present, yield,"" as in ""rendering an account"" or ""the tree renders its fruit."" By the fourteenth century, the word also incorporated the idea of handing over, delivering, or acknowledging dependency or obligation, as in ""Render unto Caesar."" These meanings are active today when we say ""rendering a verdict,"" ""rendering service,"" or ""rendering property."""|Chap 9, Para 10|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
789|9|11|"Surveillance capitalism must work both sides of the equation. On one side, its technologies are designed to render our experience into data, as in rendering oil from fat. This typically occurs outside of our awareness, let alone our consent. On the other side of the equation, every time we encounter a digital interface we make our experience available to ""datafication,"" thus ""rendering unto surveillance capitalism"" its continuous tithe of raw-material supplies."|Chap 9, Para 11|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
790|9|12|This two-sided equation is a novel arrangement. As we saw in [Chapter 1](chapter001.xhtml), the Aware Home project developed at Georgia Tech just a year before the invention of surveillance capitalism employed different practices that embodied very different assumptions: (1) that it must be the individual alone who decides what experience is rendered as data, (2) that the purpose of the data is to enrich the individual's life, and (3) that the individual is the sole arbiter []of how the data are shared or put to use. Nearly two decades later, the Aware Home is barely more than an archeological fragment reminding us of the road not taken toward an empowering digital future and a more-just division of learning in society. Down that road, it is the individual who knows, decides, and decides who decides: an end in herself, not a means to others' ends. The lesson of the Aware Home is that there can be rendition without surveillance capitalism. However, the lesson of this chapter and the next is that *there can be no surveillance capitalism without rendition.*|Chap 9, Para 12|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
791|9|13|devices like the Nest thermostat in the competition for surveillance revenues. For example, in July 2017 iRobot's autonomous vacuum cleaner, Roomba, made headlines when the company's CEO, Colin Angle, told Reuters about its data-based business strategy for the smart home, starting with a new revenue stream derived from selling floor plans of customers' homes scraped from the machine's new mapping capabilities. Angle indicated that iRobot could reach a deal to sell its maps to Google, Amazon, or Apple within the next two years. In preparation for this entry into surveillance competition, a camera, new sensors, and software had already been added to Roomba's premier line, enabling new functions, including the ability to build a map while tracking its own location. The market had rewarded iRobot's growth vision, sending the company's stock price to \$102 in June 2017 from just \$35 a year earlier, translating into a market capitalization of \$2.5 billion on revenues of \$660 million.|Chap 9, Para 13|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
792|9|14|"Privacy experts raised alarms, knowing that such data streams have virtually no legal or security protection. But Angle assured the public that iRobot would not sell data without its customers' permission and expressed confidence that ""most would give their consent in order to access the smart home functions."" Why was Angle so confident?"|Chap 9, Para 14|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
793|9|15|"According to the company's privacy policy, it is true that owners of the Roomba can control or stop the collection of usage data by ""disconnecting your WiFi or Bluetooth from the app, for example, by changing your WiFi password."" However, as Angle told tech site *Mashable* in July 2017, even when customers do not opt-in to the mapping service, the Roomba captures mapping and usage data, but only usage data ""is sent to the cloud so it can be shown on your mobile device."" What Angle neglected to say was that a []customer who refuses to share his or her home's interior mapping data with iRobot also loses most of the smart functionality of the ""autonomous"" vacuum cleaner, including the ability to use one's phone to start or pause a cleaning, schedule cleanings, review ""Clean Map reports,"" receive automatic software updates, or start a ""SPOT Clean to focus on a particularly dirty area."""|Chap 9, Para 15|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
794|9|16|"Angle's confidence-enhancing strategy goes to the heart of the larger rendition project, for which surveillance capitalist purveyors of ""smart"" home products have developed a singular approach. On the one hand, they stress that customers can opt in to data sharing. On the other hand, customers who refuse to opt in face limited product functionality and data security. In these *Requirimiento*-style relationships, instead of the *adelantados'* message, ""Bend the knee or we destroy you,"" the message here is ""Bend the knee or we degrade your purchase."""|Chap 9, Para 16|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
795|9|17|"Under this new regime, something as simple as buying a mattress now requires careful legal scrutiny of the ""abusive contracts"" that nearly everyone ignores. Consider the Sleep Number bed, with its ""smart bed technology and sleep tracking."" The company's website features a beautiful couple snuggled in bed happily glued to their smartphones as they delight in data from their SleepIQ app. The bed's base and mattress are ""customizable"" with features that raise or lower the angle of the bed and sensors that soften or firm up the mattress. Other sensors measure heart rate, breathing, and movement: ""Every morning you'll get your SleepIQ® score, representing your individual quality and length of sleep... your restful sleep, restless sleep and time out of bed... and what adjustments you can make."" The company suggests that you connect your sleep app to your fitness tracker and your thermostat in order to see how your workout or bedroom temperature affects your sleep."|Chap 9, Para 17|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
796|9|18|"A dense, twelve-page privacy policy accompanies the bed. Customers are advised that providing information is an affirmation of consent to use that information in-line with the policy, which employs the usual onerous terms: third-party sharing, Google analytics, targeted advertising, and much more. In addition, if customers create a user profile to maximize the effectiveness of the app, the company also collects ""biometric and sleep-related data about how You, a Child, and any person that uses the Bed slept, such as that person's movement, positions, respiration, and heart rate while sleeping."" It also collects all the audio signals in your bedroom. As with most such policies, []customers are advised that the company can ""share"" or ""exploit"" personal information even ""after You deactivate or cancel the Services and/or your Sleep Number account or User Profiles(s)."" Customers are warned that no data transmission or storage ""can be guaranteed to be 100% secure"" and that it does not honor ""Do Not Track"" notifications. Finally, on page 8 of the document, the policy addresses a customer's choices regarding the use of personal information: ""Whether you submit Information to Us is entirely up to You. If you decide to not submit Information, We may not be able to provide certain features, products, and/or services to you."""|Chap 9, Para 18|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
797|9|19|This same coercive *Requirimiento* twist can be found in the lengthy, dense legal compacts associated with Alphabet-owned Nest thermostats. The terms-of-service and end-user licensing agreements reveal oppressive privacy and security consequences in which sensitive information is shared with other devices, unnamed personnel, and third parties for the purposes of analysis and ultimately for trading in behavioral futures markets, action that ricochets back to the owner in the form of targeted ads and messages designed to push more products and services. Despite this, courts have generally upheld companies' claims that they bear no liability without a clear demonstration of economic harm to the consumer.|Chap 9, Para 19|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
798|9|20|"Nest takes little responsibility for the security of that information and none for how other companies will put it to use. In fact, University of London legal scholars Guido Noto La Diega and Ian Walden, who analyzed these documents, reckon that were one to enter into the Nest ecosystem of connected devices and apps, each with their own equally burdensome terms, the purchase of a single home thermostat entails the need to review nearly a thousand ""contracts."" "|Chap 9, Para 20|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
799|9|21|"This absurdity is compounded by the fact that virtually no one reads even one such ""contract."" A valuable empirical study of 543 participants familiar with surveillance and privacy law issues found that when asked to join a new online service, 74 percent opted for the ""quick join"" procedure, bypassing the terms-of-service agreement and the privacy policy. Among those who did scroll through the abusive contracts, most went directly to the ""accept"" button. The researchers calculated that the documents required at least forty-five minutes for adequate comprehension, but for those who looked at the agreements, the median time they spent was fourteen seconds."|Chap 9, Para 21|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
800|9|22|[]Should the customer refuse to agree to Nest's stipulations, the terms of service indicate that the functionality and security of the thermostat itself will be deeply compromised, no longer supported by the necessary updates meant to ensure its reliability and safety. The consequences can range from frozen pipes to failed smoke alarms to an easily hacked internal home system. In short, the effectiveness and safety of the product are brazenly held hostage to its owners' submission to rendition as conquest, by and for others' interests.|Chap 9, Para 22|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
801|9|23|"One can easily choose not to purchase a Roomba, a SleepNumber bed, or a Nest thermostat, but each of these is merely emblematic of the immense project of rendition as the first and vital step in the construction of the apparatus of ubiquity. Thousands of ""internet of things"" objects are becoming available. As La Diega and Walden conclude, in this new product regime the simple product functions that we seek are now hopelessly enmeshed in a tangled mixture of software, services, and networks."|Chap 9, Para 23|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
802|9|24|"The very idea of a functional, effective, affordable product or service as a sufficient basis for economic exchange is dying. Where you might least expect it, products of every sort are remade by the new economic requirements of connection and rendition. Each is reimagined as a gateway to the new apparatus, praised for being ""smart"" while traditional alternatives are reviled for remaining ""dumb."" It is important to acknowledge that in this context, ""smart"" is a euphemism for rendition: intelligence that is designed to render some tiny corner of lived experience as behavioral data. Each smart object is a kind of marionette; for all its ""smartness,"" it remains a hapless puppet dancing to the puppet master's hidden economic imperatives. Products, services, and applications march to the drumbeat of inevitabilism toward the promise of surveillance revenues hacked from the still-wild spaces that we call ""my reality,"" ""my home,"" ""my life,"" and ""my body."" Every smart product repeats our essential questions: What does a smart product know, and whom does it tell? *Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?*"|Chap 9, Para 24|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
803|9|25|"Examples of products determined to render, monitor, record, and communicate behavioral data proliferate, from smart vodka bottles to internet-enabled rectal thermometers, and quite literally everything in between. The business developer for a spirits company thus cites his plan for a ""connected bottle"": ""The more we learn about consumers and their behaviors, the better services we can connect to them."" Many brands are determined ""to give []packaging a speaking role in an increasingly interactive marketplace."" Global spirits distributor Diageo promises ""smart sensor-equipped bottles"" that can track purchases and sales data, and, most importantly, ""communicate with consumers' devices and switch gears---recipes versus sales promos---once the bottle is opened."" A producer of bar equipment states the case plainly enough: ""It really is all about... allowing these \[bar\] owners to see stuff that they couldn't see before and maximize their profits."""|Chap 9, Para 25|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
804|9|26|Today our homes are in surveillance capitalism's crosshairs, as competitors chased a \$14.7 billion market for smart-home devices in 2017, up from \$6.8 billion just a year earlier and expected to reach more than \$101 billion by 2021. You may have already encountered some of the early absurdities: smart toothbrushes, smart lightbulbs, smart coffee mugs, smart ovens, smart juicers, and smart utensils said to improve your digestion. Others are often more grim: a home security camera with facial recognition; an alarm system that monitors unusual vibrations before a break-in occurs; indoor GPS locators; sensors that attach to any object to analyze movement, temperature, and other variables; every kind of connected appliance; cyborg cockroaches designed to detect sound. Even the baby's nursery is reconceived as a source of fresh behavioral surplus.|Chap 9, Para 26|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
805|9|27|"An appreciation of the surveillance logic of accumulation that drives this action suggests that this network of things is already evolving into a network of coercion, in which mundane functions are ransomed for behavioral surplus. A December 2013 letter from Google's finance director to the US Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Corporate Finance provides a vivid glimpse of these facts. The letter was composed in response to an SEC query on the segmentation of Google's revenues between its desktop and mobile platforms. Google answered by stating that users would be ""viewing our ads on an increasingly wide diversity of devices in the future"" and that its advertising systems were therefore moving toward ""device agnostic"" design that made segmentation irrelevant and impractical. ""A few years from now,"" the letter stated, ""we and other companies could be serving ads and other content on refrigerators, car dashboards, thermostats, glasses, and watches, to name just a few possibilities."""|Chap 9, Para 27|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
806|9|28|"Here is at least one endgame: the ""smart home"" and its ""internet of things"" are the canvas upon which the new markets in future behavior []inscribe their presence and assert their demands in our most-intimate spaces. Key to the story is that all of this action is prosecuted in support of a larger market process that bets on the future of our behavior and over which we have no knowledge or control. Each node in the network---the vacuum cleaner, the mattress, the thermostat---must play its part, beginning with the frictionless rendition of behavior, as the whole team of seething insistent ""smart"" things joins the migration to surveillance revenues. As we are shorn of alternatives, we are forced to purchase products that we can never own while our payments fund our own surveillance and coercion. Adding insult to injury, data rendered by this wave of things are notoriously insecure and easily subject to breaches. Moreover, manufacturers have no legal responsibility to notify device owners when data are stolen or hacked."|Chap 9, Para 28|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
807|9|29|"There are other, even more grandiose ambitions for the rendition of all solitary things. Companies such as Qualcomm, Intel, and ARM are developing tiny, always-on, low-power computer vision modules that can be added to any device, such as your phone or refrigerator, or any surface.

808|9|30|"Consider ""smart skin,"" developed by brilliant university scientists and now poised for commercial elaboration. Initially valued for its ability to monitor and diagnosis health conditions from Parkinson's disease to sleep disorders, smart skin is now hailed for its promise of ultra-unobtrusive ubiquity. Researchers at Georgia Tech developed a version of ""smart skin"" that sucks energy from radio waves and other energy sources, eliminating the need for batteries. Smart skin, described as ""the ultimate sensing tool that could potentially allow for the mass implementation of perpetual wireless networks,"" can cognize, sense, analyze, wirelessly communicate, and ""modify parameters"" using simple radio frequency (RFID) technology. As in the case of Paradiso's ""sensor tape,"" the researchers stress that it can also ""be applied everywhere"" to ""monitor, sense, and interact with the world around us in a perpetual way, thus significantly enhancing ambient intelligence,"" all of it as inconspicuous as a ""decal sticker.""

809|9|31|"Rendition has become a surveillance capitalist project shaped by its imperatives and directed toward its objectives. In the composition of the []shadow text, rendition is Step One: the concrete operationalization of the ""original sin of simple robbery"" that defined this market project from the start. Google rendered the Earth, its streets, and its dwelling places, bypassing our consent and defying our protests. Facebook rendered the social network and its limitless details for the sake of the company's behavioral futures markets. Now the ubiquitous apparatus is the means to the ubiquitous rendition of human experience. We have seen the urgency with which surveillance capitalists pursue the elimination of ""friction"" as a critical success factor in supply operations. The prediction imperative makes boundaries and borders intolerable, and surveillance capitalists will do almost anything to eliminate them. This pursuit transforms ""connection"" into a commercial imperative and transforms individual autonomy into a threat to surveillance revenues."|Chap 9, Para 31|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
810|9|32|"Surveillance capitalism's rendition practices overwhelm any sensible discussion of ""opt in"" and ""opt out."" There are no more fig leaves. The euphemisms of consent can no longer divert attention from the bare facts: under surveillance capitalism, rendition is typically unauthorized, unilateral, gluttonous, secret, and brazen. These characteristics summarize the asymmetries of power that put the ""surveillance"" in surveillance capitalism. They also highlight a harsh truth: it is difficult to be where rendition is not. As industries far ferocity of the race to find and render experience as data has turned rendition into a global project of surveillance capital."|Chap 9, Para 32|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
811|9|33|This chapter and the next survey a range of rendition activities in the pursuit of economies of scope. The remainder of this chapter concentrates on *extension, the first dimension of scope*, as rendition operations move into the real world, seizing fresh unexpected chunks of human experience. Extension wants every corner and crevice, every utterance and gesture on the path to dispossession. All that is moist and alive must hand over its facts. There can be no shadow, no darkness. The unknown is intolerable. The solitary is forbidden. Later, in [Chapter 9](chapter014.xhtml), we move into the *depth* dimension. The net is cast wide over the waters of daily life, but there are also submarines exploring the depths in search of new sources of surplus prized for their rare predictive powers: your personality, emotions, and endorphins. The examples in these chapters are not intended to be exhaustive but rather to illustrate the seriousness of purpose, tenacity, and subterfuge with which surveillance capitalists []pursue their search for new aspects of human experience that can be monetized as certainty.|Chap 9, Para 33|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
812|9|34|"In this pursuit, we are necessarily involved in citing specific actors, products, and techniques, knowing that the details of persons and companies are constantly churning. Firms will be bought and sold, fail or succeed; people will come and go. Specific technologies, products, and techniques will be abandoned, refined, and surpassed. When they fall, new ones will take their place, as long as surveillance capitalism is allowed to flourish. Velocity and churn have been critical to surveillance capitalism's success, and we cannot allow the constant movement to inhibit our determination to grasp the ""laws of motion"" that command this roiling landscape. It is the pattern and its purpose that we want to grasp."|Chap 9, Para 34|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
813|9|35|"The rendition of your body begins quite simply with your phone. Even when your city is not ""smart"" or owned and operated by Google, market players with an interest in your behavior know how to find your body. For all of the elaborate ways in which surveillance capitalists labor to render reality as behavior for surplus, the simplest and most profound is their ability to know exactly where you are all the time. Your body is reimagined as a behaving object to be tracked and calculated for indexing and search. Most smartphone apps demand access to your location even when it's not necessary for the service they provide, simply because the answer to this question is so lucrative."|Chap 9, Para 35|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
814|9|36|"Location data can be extracted from ""geotags"" created when your smartphone automatically embeds your identity and location in photos and videos. Retailers use ""geofencing"" to demarcate a geographical area and send alerts to smartphones within those parameters: ""Come here now!"" ""Buy this here!"" ""An offer, just for you!"" Download the Starbucks app, and then leave your house if you want to see this in action. As one marketing consultancy advises, ""Mobile advertising, the ultimate form of geo-targeting, is the holy grail of advertising.""

These involve gathering location and other data from phones, satellites, vehicles, and sensors to assemble intelligence on the daily behavioral patterns of a ""person of interest"" in order to predict future behavior. Marketers are exhorted to ""map the daily patterns"" of a ""target audience"" in order to ""intercept people in their daily routines with brand and promotional messages.""

816|9|38|You can shut down the GPS locator on your phone, but most people do not, both because they rely on its utilities and because they are ignorant of its operations. According to Pew Research, 74 percent of US smartphone owners in 2013 used apps that required location data, and 90 percent did so in 2015---that's about 153 million people, more than those who listen to music or watch video on their phones. Surveillance capitalism's reliance on secret operations means that most of us simply do not and cannot know the extent to which our phone doubles as a tracking device for corporate surveillance.|Chap 9, Para 38|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
817|9|39|"A study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University proves the point efficiently. During a three-week period, twenty-three participants were continuously informed of the number of apps accessing their location information and the total number of accesses in a given period. They were flabbergasted by the sheer volume of the onslaught as they each variously learned that their locations were accessed 4,182 times, 5,398 times, 356 times, and so on, over a 14-day period---all for the sake of advertisers, insurers, retailers, marketing firms, mortgage companies, and anyone else who pays to play in these behavioral markets.

Fifty-eight percent of participants subsequently restricted the permissions granted to their mobile apps."|Chap 9, Para 39|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
818|9|40|"Unsurprisingly, Google represents the vanguard of location-based tracking. A 2016 affidavit from law-enforcement officials seeking a search warrant for a California bank robber made plain why Google location data are unparalleled: ""Google collects and retains location data from Android-enabled []mobile devices. Google collects this data whenever one of their services is activated and/or whenever there is an event on the mobile device such as a phone call, text messages, internet access, or email access."" The officials on the case requested location information from Google because it offers far more detail than even the phone companies can provide. The location systems in Android combine cell-tower data with GPS, Wi-Fi networks, and other information culled from photos, videos, and other sources: ""That lets Android pinpoint users to a single building, rather than a city block."" In November 2017 *Quartz* investigative reporters discovered that since early 2017, Android phones had been collecting location information by triangulating the nearest cell towers, even when location services were disabled, no apps were running, and no carrier SIM card was installed in the phone. The information was used to manage Google's ""push"" notifications and messages sent to users on their Android phones, enabling the company to track ""whether an individual with an Android phone or running Google apps has set foot in a specific store, and use that to target the advertising a user subsequently sees."""|Chap 9, Para 40|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
819|9|41|"Google's location history system is a product of the corporation's global mapping operations. Though active for over a decade, it was unveiled to the public only in 2015 as ""Your Timeline,"" a feature that ""allows you to visualize your real-world routines."" The corporation calculated that any negative reaction to the volume and persistence of tracking revealed by Timeline would be mitigated by the value of users' active contributions to their own stocks of behavioral surplus as they fine-tune the information, add relevant photos, insert comments, and so forth. This was represented as an individual's investment in personalized services such as Google Now so that it might more effectively comb your e-mail and apps in order to push relevant traffic and weather updates, notifications, suggestions, and reminders. Location data is the quid pro quo for these services."|Chap 9, Para 41|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
820|9|42|"This transaction is greased by the usual promises of privacy and control: ""Your Timeline is private and visible only to you; and you control the locations you choose to keep."" But Google uses your location data to target ads; indeed, these are among the most significant sources of surplus in Google's advertising markets with a direct impact on click rates. The standard account from Google and other surveillance capitalists is that behavioral surplus is []retained only as meta-data, which are then aggregated across large numbers of individual users. We are told that it's not possible to identify individuals from these large-scale amalgamations. However, with as little as three bits of data easily culled from the public record---birth date, zip code, and sex---reidentification science has demonstrated its ability to de-anonymize meta-data with ""disturbing ease."" In a summary of this research, legal scholar Paul Ohm writes that ""re-identification makes all our secrets fundamentally easier to discover and reveal. Our enemies will find it easier to connect us to facts that they can use to blackmail, harass, defame, frame or discriminate against us....

821|9|43|"When it comes to location data, the situation is just as bad. In 2013 a group of MIT and Harvard computer scientists demonstrated that because individuals tend to have idiosyncratic mobility signatures, any analyst with the right tools can easily extract the mobility pattern of a specific individual within a large anonymized data set of location meta-data. Another research team demonstrated that data collected by seemingly ""innocuous"" smartphone-embedded sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, can be used to infer ""an ever-growing range of human activities and even moods."" Their work also shows that these sensor data can be used ""to obtain sensitive information about specific users from anonymized datasets."""|Chap 9, Para 43|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
822|9|44|"Companies are putting these surveillance capabilities to work. Broadcom produced a ""global navigation satellite system"" in a chip that combines satellite communications with the sensors in your cell phone to create a ""positioning engine"" that can find your location even if you are not connected to a network, including your location in a building, how many steps you've taken, in what direction, at what altitude. All this depends solely on one factor, says a company vice president: ""the device in your hand."" Princeton computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Edward Felten summed it up this way: ""There is no known effective method to anonymize location data, and no evidence that it's meaningfully achievable."""|Chap 9, Para 44|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
823|9|45|"Even without ""de-anonymization,"" location meta-data constitute an unrivaled concentration of knowledge within private firms and an extraordinary []advantage in the division of learning. In 2016 Chinese search engine Baidu, often referred to as the Google of China, announced that its ""Big Data Lab"" uses location data from its 600 million users to track and predict the dynamics of the Chinese economy. The company built an ""employment index"" for the national economy as well as a ""consumption index."" It also touted its ability to generate quite-specific predictions such as Apple's second-quarter earnings in China that year.

These complex sensors can access ""environmental context... smells... emotional state...."" Google has developed internet-enabled fabrics, claiming that it aims to bring inductive yarns to every garment and fabric on Earth. ""If you can weave the sensor into the textile, as a material,"" explains project leader Ivan Poupyrev, ""you're moving away from the electronics. You're making the basic materials of the world around us interactive."" A partnership with Levi Strauss has already yielded ""interactive denim,"" including a jacket first brought to market in September 2017.

825|9|47|"There is a numbing repetition of MacKay's themes throughout the literature on wearables.

They are to be ""continuous,"" ""pervasive,"" and, crucially, ""low cost"" in order to achieve economies of scope.

When telemetry first shifted from MacKay's gaggles, flocks, and herds to the human animal, one of its first applications was as a means to oversee the vulnerable in the form of push-button pendants for elderly people alone in their homes. In 2002, the year that a still-secret surveillance capitalism achieved its first breakthroughs, a review of ""wireless telemedicine"" stressed the value of home monitoring for the elderly and for the expansion of health services in remote areas. As in the case of the Aware Home, a diagram of the proposed digital architecture for such home-monitoring services features only three parties: a closed loop that exclusively links a patient at home, her hospital's servers, and her physician. There are no extra parties imagined in either of these designs, no companies capturing your behavior, no behemoth tech firms with their porous platforms and proprietary servers transforming your life into surplus so they can make book on what you will want next and enable their customers to sell it to you first."|Chap 9, Para 48|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
827|9|49|Before the birth and spread of surveillance capitalism, it was possible to imagine digital representations of your body as an enrichment of the intimate relationships between a patient and a trusted doctor, a mother and her child, elderly parents and their adult children. As surveillance capitalism overwhelms the digital milieu, that vision has been made ridiculous. Both the Aware Home and the telemedicine design assume that all behavioral data are reinvested in service to the human being who is the subject of these arrangements, providing serenity, trust, and dignity: a chance for real knowledge and empowerment.|Chap 9, Para 49|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
828|9|50|"Many articles on health monitoring continue to emphasize its utility for the elderly, but the conversation has decisively moved on from this earlier state of grace. Some researchers anticipate the fusion of ""smart cities"" and what's now called ""m-health"" to produce ""smart health,"" defined as ""the provision of health services by using the context-aware network and sensing infrastructure of smart cities."" Toward that end, there are now reliable sensors []for rendering an increasing range of physiological processes as behavioral data, including body temperature, heart rate, brain activity, muscle motion, blood pressure, sweat rate, energy expenditure, and body and limb motion. There are sensors that can render audio, visual, and physiological data during postsurgical patient recovery and rehabilitation. A flexible, sensored textile patch has been developed that can render breathing, hand movements, swallowing, and walking as behavioral data. In other applications, ""wearable micromachined sensors"" provide ""accurate biomechanical analysis"" as you walk or run, and a ""body area network"" records and analyzes walking and running ""under extreme conditions."""|Chap 9, Para 50|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
829|9|51|It is eloquent testimony to the health care system's failure to serve the needs of second-modernity individuals that we now access health data and advice from our phones while these pocket computers aggressively access us. M-health has triggered an explosion of rendition and behavioral surplus capture as individuals turn in record numbers to their fitness bands and diet apps for support and guidance. By 2016, there were more than 100,000 mobile health apps available on the Google Android and Apple iOS platforms, double the number in 2014. These rich data can no longer be imagined as cloistered within the intimate closed loops between a patient and her doctor or between an application and its dieters or runners. That bucolic vision has its holdouts, to be sure, but for surveillance capitalists this vision is but a faded daguerreotype.|Chap 9, Para 51|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
830|9|52|"In the US, most health and fitness applications are not subject to health privacy laws, and the laws that do exist do not adequately take into account either new digital capabilities or the ferocity of surveillance capitalist operations. Companies are expected to self-regulate by following guidelines suggested by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other government agencies. For example, in 2016 the FTC issued a list of best practices for developers of mobile health applications aimed at increasing transparency, privacy, and security. Among these suggestions, developers are encouraged to ""make sure your app doesn't access consumer information it doesn't need,"" ""let consumers select particular contacts, rather than having your app request access to all user contacts through the standard API,"" and let users ""choose privacy-protective default settings."" That year the Food and Drug Administration announced that it would also *not* seek to regulate health and fitness []apps, citing their ""low-level risk."" Instead, the agency released its own set of voluntary guidelines for software developers."|Chap 9, Para 52|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
831|9|53|The agencies' well-meaning guidelines overlook the inconvenient truth that transparency and privacy represent friction for surveillance capitalists in much the same way that improving working conditions, rejecting child labor, or shortening the working day represented friction for the early industrial capitalists. It took targeted laws to change working conditions back then, not suggestions. Then as now, the problems to which these pleas for self-restraint are addressed cannot be understood as excesses, mistakes, oversights, or lapses of judgment. They are necessitated by the reigning logic of accumulation and its relentless economic imperatives.|Chap 9, Para 53|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
832|9|54|"A legal review of mobile health apps concludes that most of them ""take the consumers' private information and data without the consumers' permission and... do not generally disclose to the user that this information will be sent to advertising companies."" These conclusions are borne out by a long queue of studies, but let's focus on a 2016 in-depth investigation by scholars from the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto in association with Open Effect, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy and security. This study looked at the collection, processing, and usage activities associated with nine fitness trackers. Seven were chosen for their popularity, one was made by a Canadian company, and the ninth was an app that specialized in women's health. All but two apps transmitted every logged fitness event to the company's servers, which enabled backup and sharing with one's friends but also ""data analytics"" and distribution to third parties. Some of the trackers transmitted device identification numbers; others passively and continuously transmitted the user's precise longitude and latitude coordinates. These identifiers ""could link fitness and biographical data to a single mobile phone hardware, or single specific fitness wearable...."" None of this sensitive information was necessary for the tracker to operate effectively, and most of the privacy policies were opaque at best and allowed data to be ""sold or exchanged with third parties."" As we know, once a third party captures your surplus, it is shared with other third parties, who share with other third parties, and so on."|Chap 9, Para 54|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
833|9|55|"The team also examined the trackers' transmission of the Bluetooth Media Access Controller or ""MAC"" address that is unique to each phone. When []this address is publicly discoverable, any third party with an interest in your movements---retailers who want to know your mall activity, insurers concerned about your compliance with an exercise regime---can ""persistently"" track your phone. Multiple data sets logged over time can be combined to form a fine-grained picture of your movements, enabling targeted applications and heightening the probability of guaranteed outcomes. The only real protection is when an app randomly but regularly generates a new MAC address for your phone, but of the nine trackers, only Apple's performed this operation."|Chap 9, Para 55|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
834|9|56|"The report also identifies a general pattern of careless security as well as the ability to generate false data. The researchers observed that consumers are likely to be misled and confused, overestimating the extent of security measures and underestimating ""the breadth of personal data collected by fitness tracking companies."" As they concluded, ""We discovered severe security vulnerabilities, incredibly sensitive geolocation transmissions that serve no apparent benefit to the end user, and... policies leaving the door open for the sale of users' fitness data to third parties without express consent of the users."""|Chap 9, Para 56|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
835|9|57|"If you are inclined to dismiss this report because fitness trackers can be written off as toys, let's consider a look at an incisive investigation into Android-based diabetes apps in a 2016 *Journal of American Medicine* research report and, with it, ample illustration of the frenzy of body rendition. The researchers note that although the FDA approved the prescription of a range of apps that transmit sensitive health data, the behind-the-scenes practices of these apps are ""*understudied.""* They examined 211 diabetes apps and randomly sampled 65 of them for close analysis of data-transmission practices."|Chap 9, Para 57|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
836|9|58|"Among these apps, merely downloading the software automatically ""authorized collection and modification of sensitive information."" The researchers identified a great deal of backstage action, including apps that modify or delete your information (64 percent), read your phone status and identity (31 percent), gather location data (27 percent), view your Wi-Fi connections (12 percent), and activate your camera in order to access your photos and videos (11 percent). Between 4 percent and 6 percent of the apps went even further: reading your contact lists, calling phone numbers found in your device, []modifying your contacts, reading your call log, and activating your microphone to record your speech."|Chap 9, Para 58|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
837|9|59|"Finally, the research team unearthed an even darker secret: privacy policies do not matter. Of the 211 apps in the group, 81 percent did not have privacy policies, but for those that did, ""not all of the provisions actually protected privacy."" Of those apps *without* privacy policies, 76 percent shared sensitive information with third parties, and of those *with* privacy policies, 79 percent shared data while only about half admitted doing so in their published disclosures. In other words, privacy policies are more aptly referred to as *surveillance policies,* and that is what I suggest we call them."|Chap 9, Para 59|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
838|9|60|"There are many new territories of body rendition: organs, blood, eyes, brain waves, faces, gait, posture. Each of these expresses the same patterns and purpose that we have seen here. The surveillance capitalists relentlessly fight any attempts to constrain rendition. The ferocity with which they claim their ""right to rendition"" out of thin air is ample evidence of its foundational importance in the pursuit of surveillance revenues."|Chap 9, Para 60|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
839|9|61|This ferocity is well illustrated in surveillance capitalists' determination to discourage, eliminate, or weaken any laws governing the rendition of biometric information, especially facial recognition. Because there is no federal law in the US that regulates facial recognition, these battles occur at the state level. Currently, the Illinois Biometric Privacy Act offers the most comprehensive legal protections, requiring companies to obtain written consent before collecting biometric information from any individual and, among other stipulations, granting individuals the right to sue a company for unauthorized rendition.|Chap 9, Para 61|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
840|9|62|"The Center for Public Integrity, along with journalists, privacy advocates, and legal scholars, has documented the active opposition of surveillance capitalists to the Illinois law and similar legislative proposals in other states. With its unique competitive advantages in facial recognition, Facebook is considered the most uncompromising of all the tech companies when it comes to biometric data, described as ""working feverishly to prevent other states from enacting a law like the one in Illinois."""|Chap 9, Para 62|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
841|9|63|"Facebook's considerable political muscle had been cultivated in just a few years as it learned to emulate Google's playbook of political and cultural fortifications. The company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, demonstrated an iron []determination to preserve his freedom in lawless space, pushing the boundaries of existing regulations and vigorously opposing even the whisper of new law. Between 2009 and 2017, the company increased its lobbying spend by a factor of fifty, building ""a massive lobbying entourage of Washington power brokers."" Facebook's \$4.6 million in donations during the 2016 election cycle complemented its lobbying budget of \$11.5 million in 2017."|Chap 9, Para 63|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
842|9|64|"Zuckerberg's advantages in biometrics are significant. In 2017 Facebook boasted two billion monthly users uploading 350 million photos every day, a supply operation that the corporation's own researchers refer to as ""practically infinite."" In 2018 a Facebook research team announced that it had ""closed the gap"" and was now able to recognize faces ""in the wild"" with 97.35 percent accuracy, ""closely approaching human-level performance."" The report highlights the corporation's supply and manufacturing advantages, especially the use of ""deep learning"" based on ""large training sets."" Facebook announced its eagerness to use facial recognition as a means to more powerful ad targeting, but even more of the uplift would come from the immense machine training opportunities represented by so many photos. By 2018, its machines were learning to discern activities, interests, mood, gaze, clothing, gait, hair, body type, and posture. The marketing possibilities are infinite."|Chap 9, Para 64|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
843|9|65|It should not surprise any student of the prediction imperative that with these advantages in hand, Facebook is unwilling to accept anything less than total conquest in its bid to render faces for the sake of more-lucrative prediction products. So far, Facebook and its brethren have been successful, turning back legislative proposals in Montana, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Alaska, and fatally weakening a bill that was passed in Washington state. Among the tech companies, only Facebook continued to oppose even the diminished terms of the Washington legislation.|Chap 9, Para 65|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
844|9|66|"If rendition is interrupted, surveillance capitalism cannot stand, for the whole enterprise rests on this original sin. This fact is amply displayed in the public drama surrounding the ill-fated 2015 attempt to produce public guidelines on the creation and use of biometric information through a voluntary ""privacy multi-stakeholder"" process convened by the National Telecommunications and Information Association (NTIA) under the auspices of the US Department of Commerce. After weeks of negotiations, consumer advocates []walked out in protest over the hard-line position of the tech companies and their lobbyists on the single most pivotal issue: consent."|Chap 9, Para 66|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
845|9|67|"The companies insisted on their right to use facial-recognition systems to identify a ""stranger on the street"" without first obtaining the individual's consent. As one lobbyist in the talks told the press, ""Everyone has the right to take photographs in public... if someone wants to apply facial recognition, should they really need to get consent in advance?"" Privacy scholars were quick to respond that there is no lawfully established right to such actions, let alone a First Amendment right. Nobody reckoned with the fact that the prediction imperative makes individual ignorance the preferred condition for rendition operations, just as Arendt had observed and Mackay had prescribed for animals in the wild. Original sin prefers the dark."|Chap 9, Para 67|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
846|9|68|"The talks continued without the advocates, and in 2016 the NTIA issued its ""Privacy Best Practice Recommendations for Commercial Facial Recognition Use."" The guidelines should be understood as the ""best"" for the surveillance capitalists but as the ""worst"" for everyone else. In the language of these guidelines, the tech companies, retailers, and others determined to chase surveillance revenues are simply ""encouraged"" to make their policies on facial recognition ""available to consumers, in a reasonable manner...."" Where companies impose facial recognition on a physical location, they are ""encouraged"" to provide ""notice"" to consumers. Rendition operations are tacitly accorded legitimacy, not only in the lack of contest, but because they stand as the immovable facts draped in the cheap garlands of toothless ""best practices."" Georgetown University legal scholar Alvaro Bedoya, a member of the advocacy group that quit the deliberations, blasted the recommendations as ""a mockery of the Fair Information Practice Principles on which they claim to be grounded""; they offer ""no real protection for individuals"" and ""cannot be taken seriously."""|Chap 9, Para 68|09 MAKE THEM DANCE
847|9|69|Under the regime of surveillance capitalism, individuals do not render their experience out of choice or obligation but rather out of ignorance and the dictatorship of no alternatives. The ubiquitous apparatus operates through coercion and stealth. Our advance into life necessarily takes us through the digital, where involuntary rendition has become an inescapable fact. We are left with few rights to know, or to decide who knows, or []to decide who decides. This abnormal division of learning is created and sustained by secret fiat, implemented by invisible methods, and directed by companies bent to the economic imperatives of a strange new market form. Surveillance capitalists impose their will backstage, while the actors perform the stylized lullabies of disclosure and agreement for the public.|Chap 9, Para 69|09 MAKE THEM DANCE

849|10|5|Google is to surveillance capitalism what the Ford Motor Company and General Motors were to mass-production--based managerial capitalism. New economic logics and their commercial models are discovered by people in a time and place and then perfected through trial and error. In our time Google became the pioneer, discoverer, elaborator, experimenter, lead practitioner, role model, and diffusion hub of *surveillance capitalism.* GM and Ford's iconic status as pioneers of twentieth-century capitalism made them enduring objects of scholarly research and public fascination because the lessons they had to teach resonated far beyond the individual companies. Google's practices deserve the same kind of examination, not merely as a critique of a single company but rather as the starting point for the codification of a powerful new form of capitalism.|Chap 10, Para 5|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
850|10|6|"With the triumph of mass production at Ford and for decades thereafter, hundreds of researchers, businesspeople, engineers, journalists, and scholars would excavate the circumstances of its invention, origins, and []consequences. Decades later, scholars continued to write extensively about Ford, the man and the company. GM has also been an object of intense scrutiny. It was the site of Peter Drucker's field studies for his seminal *Concept of the Corporation,* the 1946 book that codified the practices of the twentieth-century business organization and established Drucker's reputation as a management sage. In addition to the many works of scholarship and analysis on these two firms, their own leaders enthusiastically articulated their discoveries and practices. Henry Ford and his general manager, James Couzens, and Alfred Sloan and his marketing man, Henry ""Buck"" Weaver, reflected on, conceptualized, and proselytized their achievements, specifically locating them in the evolutionary drama of American capitalism."|Chap 10, Para 6|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
851|10|7|"Google is a notoriously secretive company, and one is hard-pressed to imagine a Drucker equivalent freely roaming the scene and scribbling in the hallways. Its executives carefully craft their messages of digital evangelism in books and blog posts, but its operations are not easily accessible to outside researchers or journalists. In 2016 a lawsuit brought against the company by a product manager alleged an internal spying program in which employees are expected to identify coworkers who violate the firm's confidentiality agreement: a broad prohibition against divulging anything about the company to anyone. The closest thing we have to a Buck Weaver or James Couzens codifying Google's practices and objectives is the company's longtime chief economist, Hal Varian, who aids the cause of understanding with scholarly articles that explore important themes. Varian has been described as ""the Adam Smith of the discipline of Googlenomics"" and the ""godfather"" of its advertising model. It is in Varian's work that we find hidden-in-plain-sight important clues to the logic of surveillance capitalism and its claims to power."|Chap 10, Para 7|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
852|10|8|"In two extraordinary articles in scholarly journals, Varian explored the theme of ""computer-mediated transactions"" and their transformational effects on the modern economy. Both pieces are written in amiable, down-to-earth prose, but Varian's casual understatement stands in counterpoint to his often-startling declarations: ""Nowadays there is a computer in the middle of virtually every transaction... now that they are available these computers have several other uses."" He then identifies four such new uses: ""data extraction and analysis,"" ""new contractual forms due to better monitoring,"" ""personalization and customization,"" and ""continuous experiments."""|Chap 10, Para 8|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
853|10|9|"[]Varian's discussions of these new ""uses"" are an unexpected guide to the strange logic of surveillance capitalism, the division of learning that it shapes, and the character of the information civilization toward which it leads. We will return to Varian's observations from time to time in the course of our examination of the foundations of surveillance capitalism, aided by a kind of ""reverse engineering"" of his assertions, so that we might grasp the worldview and methods of surveillance capitalism through this lens. ""Data extraction and analysis,"" Varian writes, ""is what everyone is talking about when they talk about big data."" ""Data"" are the raw material necessary for surveillance capitalism's novel manufacturing processes. ""Extraction"" describes the social relations and material infrastructure with which the firm asserts authority over those raw materials to achieve economies of scale in its raw-material supply operations. ""Analysis"" refers to the complex of highly specialized computational systems that I will generally refer to in these chapters as ""machine intelligence."" I like this umbrella phrase because it trains us on the forest rather than the trees, helping us decenter from technology to its objectives. But in choosing this phrase I also follow Google's lead. The company describes itself ""at the forefront of innovation in machine intelligence,"" a term in which it includes machine learning as well as ""classical"" algorithmic production, along with many computational operations that are often referred to with other terms such as ""predictive analytics"" or ""artificial intelligence."" Among these operations Google cites its work on language translation, speech recognition, visual processing, ranking, statistical modeling, and prediction: ""In all of those tasks and many others, we gather large volumes of direct or indirect evidence of relationships of interest, applying learning algorithms to understand and generalize."" These machine intelligence operations convert raw material into the firm's highly profitable algorithmic products designed to predict the behavior of its users. The inscrutability and exclusivity of these techniques and operations are the moat that surrounds the castle and secures the action within."|Chap 10, Para 9|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
854|10|10|"Google's invention of targeted advertising paved the way to financial success, but it also laid the cornerstone of a more far-reaching development: the discovery and elaboration of surveillance capitalism. Its business is characterized as an advertising model, and much has been written about Google's automated auction methods and other aspects of its inventions in the field of online advertising. With so much verbiage, these developments are both []over-described and under-theorized. Our aim in this chapter and those that follow in Part I is to reveal the ""laws of motion"" that drive surveillance competition, and in order to do this we begin by looking freshly at the point of origin, when the foundational mechanisms of surveillance capitalism were first discovered."|Chap 10, Para 10|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
855|10|11|"Before we begin, I want to say a word about vocabulary. Any confrontation with the unprecedented requires new language, and I introduce new terms when existing language fails to capture a new phenomenon. Sometimes, however, I intentionally repurpose familiar language because I want to stress certain continuities in the function of an element or process. This is the case with ""laws of motion,"" borrowed from Newton's laws of inertia, force, and equal and opposite reactions."|Chap 10, Para 11|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
856|10|12|"Over the years historians have adopted this term to describe the ""laws"" of industrial capitalism. For example, economic historian Ellen Meiksins Wood documents the origins of capitalism in the changing relations between English property owners and tenant farmers, as the owners began to favor productivity over coercion: ""The new historical dynamic allows us to speak of 'agrarian capitalism' in early modern England, a social form with distinctive 'laws of motion' that would eventually give rise to capitalism in its mature, industrial form."" Wood describes how the new ""laws of motion"" eventually manifested themselves in industrial production:"|Chap 10, Para 12|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
857|10|13|":::  The critical factor in the divergence of capitalism from all other forms of ""commercial society"" was the development of certain social property relations that generated market imperatives and capitalist ""laws of motion""... competitive production and profit-maximization, the compulsion to reinvest surpluses, and the relentless need to improve labour-productivity associated with capitalism.... Those laws of motion required vast social transformations and upheavals to set them in train. They required a transformation in the human metabolism with nature, in the provision of life's basic necessities. :::"|Chap 10, Para 13|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
858|10|14|"My argument here is that although surveillance capitalism does not abandon established capitalist ""laws"" such as competitive production, profit maximization, productivity, and growth, these earlier dynamics now operate []in the context of a new logic of accumulation that also introduces its own distinctive laws of motion. Here and in following chapters, we will examine these foundational dynamics, including surveillance capitalism's idiosyncratic economic imperatives defined by extraction and prediction, its unique approach to economies of scale and scope in raw-material supply, its necessary construction and elaboration of *means of behavioral modification* that incorporate its machine-intelligence--based ""means of production"" in a more complex system of action, and the ways in which the requirements of behavioral modification orient all operations toward totalities of information and control, creating the framework for an unprecedented *instrumentarian power* and its societal implications.

859|10|15|Google was incorporated in 1998, founded by Stanford graduate students Larry Page and Sergey Brin just two years after the Mosaic browser threw open the doors of the world wide web to the computer-using public. From the start, the company embodied the promise of information capitalism as a liberating and democratic social force that galvanized and delighted second-modernity populations around the world.|Chap 10, Para 15|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
860|10|16|Thanks to this wide embrace, Google successfully imposed computer mediation on broad new domains of human behavior as people searched online and engaged with the web through a growing roster of Google services. As these new activities were informated for the first time, they produced wholly new data resources. For example, in addition to key words, each Google search query produces a wake of collateral data such as the number and pattern of search terms, how a query is phrased, spelling, punctuation, dwell times, click patterns, and location.|Chap 10, Para 16|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
861|10|17|"Early on, these behavioral by-products were haphazardly stored and operationally ignored. Amit Patel, a young Stanford graduate student with a special interest in ""data mining,"" is frequently credited with the groundbreaking insight into the significance of Google's accidental data caches. His work []with these data logs persuaded him that detailed stories about each user---thoughts, feelings, interests---could be constructed from the wake of unstructured signals that trailed every online action. These data, he concluded, actually provided a ""broad sensor of human behavior"" and could be put to immediate use in realizing cofounder Larry Page's dream of Search as a comprehensive artificial intelligence."|Chap 10, Para 17|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
862|10|18|Google's engineers soon grasped that the continuous flows of collateral behavioral data could turn the search engine into a recursive learning system that constantly improved search results and spurred product innovations such as spell check, translation, and voice recognition. As Kenneth Cukier observed at that time,|Chap 10, Para 18|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
863|10|19|:::  Other search engines in the 1990s had the chance to do the same, but did not pursue it. Around 2000 Yahoo! saw the potential, but nothing came of the idea. It was Google that recognized the gold dust in the detritus of its interactions with its users and took the trouble to collect it up.... Google exploits information that is a by-product of user interactions, or data exhaust, which is automatically recycled to improve the service or create an entirely new product. :::|Chap 10, Para 19|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
864|10|20|"What had been regarded as waste material---""data exhaust"" spewed into Google's servers during the combustive action of Search---was quickly reimagined as a critical element in the transformation of Google's search engine into a reflexive process of continuous learning and improvement."|Chap 10, Para 20|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
865|10|21|"At that early stage of Google's development, the feedback loops involved in improving its Search functions produced a balance of power: Search needed people to learn from, and people needed Search to learn from. This symbiosis enabled Google's algorithms to learn and produce ever-more relevant and comprehensive search results. More queries meant more learning; more learning produced more relevance. More relevance meant more searches and more users. By the time the young company held its first press conference in 1999, to announce a \$25 million equity investment from two of the most revered Silicon Valley venture capital firms, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins, Google Search was already fielding seven million requests each day. A few years later, Hal Varian, who joined Google as its chief []economist in 2002, would note, ""Every action a user performs is considered a signal to be analyzed and fed back into the system."" The Page Rank algorithm, named after its founder, had already given Google a significant advantage in identifying the most popular results for queries. Over the course of the next few years it would be the capture, storage, analysis, and learning from the by-products of those search queries that would turn Google into the gold standard of web search."|Chap 10, Para 21|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
866|10|22|The key point for us rests on a critical distinction. During this early period, behavioral data were put to work entirely on the user's behalf. User data provided value at no cost, and that value was reinvested in the user experience in the form of improved services: enhancements that were also offered at no cost to users. Users provided the raw material in the form of behavioral data, and those data were harvested to improve speed, accuracy, and relevance and to help build ancillary products such as translation. I call this the *behavioral value reinvestment cycle,* in which all behavioral data are reinvested in the improvement of the product or service (see [Figure 1](chapter003.xhtml#fig1)).|Chap 10, Para 22|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
867|10|23|"The cycle emulates the logic of the iPod; it worked beautifully at Google but with one critical difference: the absence of a sustainable market transaction. In the case of the iPod, the cycle was triggered by the purchase of a high-margin physical product. Subsequent reciprocities improved the iPod product and led to increased sales. Customers were the subjects of the commercial process, which promised alignment with their ""what I want, when I want, where I want"" demands. At Google, the cycle was similarly oriented toward the individual as its subject, but without a physical product to sell, it floated outside the marketplace, an interaction with ""users"" rather than a market transaction with customers."|Chap 10, Para 23|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
868|10|24|"This helps to explain why it is inaccurate to think of Google's users as its customers: there is no economic exchange, no price, and no profit. Nor do users function in the role of workers. When a capitalist hires workers and provides them with wages and means of production, the products that they produce belong to the capitalist to sell at a profit. Not so here. Users are not paid for their labor, nor do they operate the means of production, as we'll discuss in more depth later in this chapter. Finally, people often say that the user is the ""product."" This is also misleading, and it is a point that we will revisit more than once. For now let's say that users are not products, but rather []we are the sources of raw-material supply. As we shall see, surveillance capitalism's unusual products manage to be derived from our behavior while remaining indifferent to our behavior. Its products are about predicting us, without actually caring what we do or what is done to us."|Chap 10, Para 24|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
869|10|25|"To summarize, at this early stage of Google's development, whatever Search users inadvertently gave up that was of value to the company they also used up in the form of improved services. In this reinvestment cycle, serving users with amazing Search results ""consumed"" all the value that users created when they provided extra behavioral data. The fact that users needed Search about as much as Search needed users created a balance of power between Google and its populations. People were treated as ends in themselves, the subjects of a nonmarket, self-contained cycle that was perfectly aligned with Google's stated mission ""to organize the world's information, making it universally accessible and useful."""|Chap 10, Para 25|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
870|10|28|By 1999, despite the splendor of Google's new world of searchable web pages, its growing computer science capabilities, and its glamorous venture backers, there was no reliable way to turn investors' money into revenue. The behavioral value reinvestment cycle produced a very cool search function, but it was not yet capitalism. The balance of power made it financially risky and possibly counterproductive to charge users a fee for search services. Selling search results would also have set a dangerous precedent for the firm, assigning a price to indexed information that Google's web crawler had already taken from others without payment. Without a device like Apple's iPod or its digital songs, there were no margins, no surplus, nothing left over to sell and turn into revenue.|Chap 10, Para 28|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
871|10|29|"Google had relegated advertising to steerage class: its AdWords team consisted of seven people, most of whom shared the founders' general antipathy toward ads. The tone had been set in Sergey Brin and Larry Page's milestone paper that unveiled their search engine conception, ""The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine,"" presented at the 1998 World Wide Web Conference: ""We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant effect on the market... we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm."""|Chap 10, Para 29|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
872|10|30|Google's first revenues depended instead on exclusive licensing deals to provide web services to portals such as Yahoo! and Japan's BIGLOBE. It also generated modest revenue from sponsored ads linked to search query keywords. There were other models for consideration. Rival search engines such as Overture, used exclusively by the then-giant portal AOL, or Inktomi, the search engine adopted by Microsoft, collected revenues from the sites whose pages they indexed. Overture was also successful in attracting online ads with its policy of allowing advertisers to pay for high-ranking search listings, the very format that Brin and Page scorned.|Chap 10, Para 30|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
873|10|31|"[]Prominent analysts publicly doubted whether Google could compete with its more-established rivals. As the *New York Times* asked, ""Can Google create a business model even remotely as good as its technology?"" A well-known Forrester Research analyst proclaimed that there were only a few ways for Google to make money with Search: ""build a portal \[like Yahoo!\]... partner with a portal... license the technology... wait for a big company to purchase them."""|Chap 10, Para 31|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
874|10|32|Despite these general misgivings about Google's viability, the firm's prestigious venture backing gave the founders confidence in their ability to raise money. This changed abruptly in April 2000, when the legendary dot-com economy began its steep plunge into recession, and Silicon Valley's Garden of Eden unexpectedly became the epicenter of a financial earthquake.|Chap 10, Para 32|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
875|10|33|"By mid-April, Silicon Valley's fast-money culture of privilege was under siege with the implosion of what came to be known as the ""dot-com bubble."" It is easy to forget exactly how terrifying things were for the valley's ambitious young people and their slightly older investors. Startups with outsized valuations just months earlier were suddenly forced to shutter. Prominent articles such as ""Doom Stalks the Dotcoms"" noted that the stock prices of Wall Street's most-revered internet ""high flyers"" were ""down for the count,"" with many of them trading below their initial offering price: ""With many dotcoms declining, neither venture capitalists nor Wall Street is eager to give them a dime...."" The news brimmed with descriptions of shell-shocked investors. The week of April 10 saw the worst decline in the history of the NASDAQ, where many internet companies had gone public, and there was a growing consensus that the ""game"" had irreversibly changed."|Chap 10, Para 33|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
876|10|34|As the business environment in Silicon Valley unraveled, investors' prospects for cashing out by selling Google to a big company seemed far less likely, and they were not immune to the rising tide of panic. Many Google investors began to express doubts about the company's prospects, and some threatened to withdraw support. Pressure for profit mounted sharply, despite the fact that Google Search was widely considered the best of all the search engines, traffic to its website was surging, and a thousand résumés flooded the firm's Mountain View office each day. Page and Brin were seen to be moving too slowly, and their top venture capitalists, John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins and Michael Moritz from Sequoia, were frustrated. According to Google chronicler Steven Levy,|Chap 10, Para 34|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
877|10|35|"[]""The VCs were screaming bloody murder. Tech's salad days were over, and it wasn't certain that Google would avoid becoming another crushed radish."""|Chap 10, Para 35|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
878|10|36|"The specific character of Silicon Valley's venture funding, especially during the years leading up to dangerous levels of startup inflation, also contributed to a growing sense of emergency at Google. As Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter and his colleague Michel Ferrary found in their study of valley venture firms, ""A connection with a high-status VC firm signals the high status of the startup and encourages other agents to link to it."" These themes may seem obvious now, but it is useful to mark the anxiety of those months of sudden crisis. Prestigious risk investment functioned as a form of vetting---much like acceptance to a top university sorts and legitimates students, elevating a few against the backdrop of the many---especially in the ""uncertain"" environment characteristic of high-tech investing. Loss of that high-status signaling power assigned a young company to a long list of also-rans in Silicon Valley's fast-moving saga."|Chap 10, Para 36|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
879|10|37|"Other research findings point to the consequences of the impatient money that flooded the valley as inflationary hype drew speculators and ratcheted up the volatility of venture funding. Studies of pre-bubble investment patterns showed a ""big-score"" mentality in which bad results tended to stimulate increased investing as funders chased the belief that some young company would suddenly discover the elusive business model destined to turn all their bets into rivers of gold. Startup mortality rates in Silicon Valley outstripped those for other venture capital centers such as Boston and Washington, DC, with impatient money producing a few big wins and many losses. Impatient money is also reflected in the size of Silicon Valley startups, which during this period were significantly smaller than in other regions, employing an average of 68 employees as compared to an average of 112 in the rest of the country. This reflects an interest in quick returns without spending much time on growing a business or deepening its talent base, let alone developing the institutional capabilities that Joseph Schumpeter would have advised. These propensities were exacerbated by the larger Silicon Valley culture, where net worth was celebrated as the sole measure of success for valley parents and their children."|Chap 10, Para 37|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
880|10|38|"For all their genius and principled insights, Brin and Page could not ignore the mounting sense of emergency. By December 2000, the *Wall Street []Journal* reported on the new ""mantra"" emerging from Silicon Valley's investment community: ""Simply displaying the ability to make money will not be enough to remain a major player in the years ahead. What will be required will be an ability to show sustained and exponential profits."""|Chap 10, Para 38|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
881|10|39|"The declaration of a state of exception functions in politics as cover for the suspension of the rule of law and the introduction of new executive powers justified by crisis. At Google in late 2000, it became a rationale for annulling the reciprocal relationship that existed between Google and its users, steeling the founders to abandon their passionate and public opposition to advertising. As a specific response to investors' anxiety, the founders tasked the tiny AdWords team with the objective of looking for ways to make more money. Page demanded that the whole process be simplified for advertisers. In this new approach, he insisted that advertisers ""shouldn't even get involved with choosing keywords---*Google would choose them.*"""|Chap 10, Para 39|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
882|10|40|"Operationally, this meant that Google would turn its own growing cache of behavioral data and its computational power and expertise toward the single task of matching ads with queries. New rhetoric took hold to legitimate this unusual move. If there was to be advertising, then it had to be ""relevant"" to users. Ads would no longer be linked to keywords in a search query, but rather a particular ad would be ""targeted"" to a particular individual. Securing this holy grail of advertising would ensure relevance to users and value to advertisers."|Chap 10, Para 40|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
883|10|41|"Absent from the new rhetoric was the fact that in pursuit of this new aim, Google would cross into virgin territory by exploiting sensitivities that only its exclusive and detailed collateral behavioral data about millions and later billions of users could reveal. To meet the new objective, the behavioral value reinvestment cycle was rapidly and secretly subordinated to a larger and more complex undertaking. The raw materials that had been solely used to improve the quality of search results would now also be put to use in the service of targeting advertising to individual users. Some data would continue to []be applied to service improvement, but the growing stores of collateral signals would be repurposed to improve the profitability of ads for both Google and its advertisers. These behavioral data available for uses *beyond* service improvement constituted a surplus, and it was on the strength of this *behavioral surplus* that the young company would find its way to the ""sustained and exponential profits"" that would be necessary for survival. Thanks to a perceived emergency, a new mutation began to gather form and quietly slip its moorings in the implicit advocacy-oriented social contract of the firm's original relationship with users."|Chap 10, Para 41|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
884|10|42|"Google's declared state of exception was the backdrop for 2002, the watershed year during which surveillance capitalism took root. The firm's appreciation of behavioral surplus crossed another threshold that April, when the data logs team arrived at their offices one morning to find that a peculiar phrase had surged to the top of the search queries: ""Carol Brady's maiden name."" Why the sudden interest in a 1970s television character? It was data scientist and logs team member Amit Patel who recounted the event to the *New York Times,* noting, ""You can't interpret it unless you know what else is going on in the world."""|Chap 10, Para 42|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
885|10|43|The team went to work to solve the puzzle. First, they discerned that the pattern of queries had produced five separate spikes, each beginning at forty-eight minutes after the hour. Then they learned that the query pattern occurred during the airing of the popular TV show *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?* The spikes reflected the successive time zones during which the show aired, ending in Hawaii. In each time zone, the show's host posed the question of Carol Brady's maiden name, and in each zone the queries immediately flooded into Google's servers.|Chap 10, Para 43|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
886|10|44|"As the *New York Times* reported, ""The precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some."" Even Brin was stunned by the clarity of Search's predictive power, revealing events and trends before they ""hit the radar"" of traditional media. As he told the *Times,* ""It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time. It was like a moment-by-moment barometer."" Google executives were described by the *Times* as reluctant to share their thoughts about how their massive stores of query data might be commercialized. ""There is tremendous opportunity with this data,"" one executive confided."|Chap 10, Para 44|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
887|10|45|"[]Just a month before the Carol Brady moment, while the AdWords team was already working on new approaches, Brin and Page hired Eric Schmidt, an experienced executive, engineer, and computer science Ph.D., as chairman. By August, they appointed him to the CEO's role. Doerr and Moritz had been pushing the founders to hire a professional manager who would know how to pivot the firm toward profit. Schmidt immediately implemented a ""belt-tightening"" program, grabbing the budgetary reins and heightening the general sense of financial alarm as fund-raising prospects came under threat. A squeeze on workspace found him unexpectedly sharing his office with none other than Amit Patel."|Chap 10, Para 45|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
888|10|46|Schmidt later boasted that as a result of their close quarters over the course of several months, he had instant access to better revenue figures than did his own financial planners. We do not know (and may never know) what other insights Schmidt might have gleaned from Patel about the predictive power of Google's behavioral data stores, but there is no doubt that a deeper grasp of the predictive power of data quickly shaped Google's specific response to financial emergency, triggering the crucial mutation that ultimately turned AdWords, Google, the internet, and the very nature of information capitalism toward an astonishingly lucrative surveillance project.|Chap 10, Para 46|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
889|10|47|"Google's earliest ads had been considered more effective than most online advertising at the time because they were linked to search queries and Google could track when users actually clicked on an ad, known as the ""click-through"" rate. Despite this, advertisers were billed in the conventional manner according to how many people viewed an ad. As Search expanded, Google created the self-service system called AdWords, in which a search that used the advertiser's keyword would include that advertiser's text box and a link to its landing page. Ad pricing depended upon the ad's position on the search results page."|Chap 10, Para 47|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
890|10|48|"Rival search startup Overture had developed an online auction system for web page placement that allowed it to scale online advertising targeted to keywords. Google would produce a transformational enhancement to that model, one that was destined to alter the course of information capitalism. As a Bloomberg journalist explained in 2006, ""Google maximizes the revenue it gets from that precious real estate by giving its best position to the advertiser who is likely to pay Google the most in total, based on the price per click []*multiplied by Google's estimate of the likelihood that someone will actually click on the ad.*"" That pivotal multiplier was the result of Google's advanced computational capabilities trained on its most significant and secret discovery: behavioral surplus. From this point forward, the combination of ever-increasing machine intelligence and ever-more-vast supplies of behavioral surplus would become the foundation of an unprecedented logic of accumulation. Google's reinvestment priorities would shift from merely improving its user offerings to inventing and institutionalizing the most far-reaching and technologically advanced raw-material supply operations that the world had ever seen. Henceforth, revenues and growth would depend upon more behavioral surplus."|Chap 10, Para 48|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
891|10|49|"Google's many patents filed during those early years illustrate the explosion of discovery, inventiveness, and complexity detonated by the state of exception that led to these crucial innovations and the firm's determination to advance the capture of behavioral surplus. Among these efforts, I focus here on one patent submitted in 2003 by three of the firm's top computer scientists and titled ""Generating User Information for Use in Targeted Advertising."" The patent is emblematic of the new mutation and the emerging logic of accumulation that would define Google's success. Of even greater interest, it also provides an unusual glimpse into the ""economic orientation"" baked deep into the technology cake by reflecting the mindset of Google's distinguished scientists as they harnessed their knowledge to the firm's new aims. In this way, the patent stands as a treatise on a new political economics of clicks and its moral universe, before the company learned to disguise this project in a fog of euphemism."|Chap 10, Para 49|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
892|10|50|"The patent reveals a pivoting of the backstage operation toward Google's new audience of genuine customers. ""The present invention concerns advertising,"" the inventors announce. Despite the enormous quantity of demographic data available to advertisers, the scientists note that much of an ad budget ""is simply wasted... it is very difficult to identify and eliminate such waste."""|Chap 10, Para 50|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
893|10|51|"Advertising had always been a guessing game: art, relationships, conventional wisdom, standard practice, but never ""science."" The idea of being able to deliver a particular message to a particular person at just the moment when it might have a high probability of actually influencing his or her []behavior was, and had always been, the holy grail of advertising. The inventors point out that online ad systems had also failed to achieve this elusive goal. The then-predominant approaches used by Google's competitors, in which ads were targeted to keywords or content, were unable to identify relevant ads ""for a *particular* user."" Now the inventors offered a scientific solution that exceeded the most-ambitious dreams of any advertising executive:"|Chap 10, Para 51|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
894|10|52|:::  There is a need to increase the relevancy of ads served for some user request, such as a search query or a document request... to the user that submitted the request....

895|10|53|In other words, Google would no longer mine behavioral data strictly to improve service for users but rather to read users' minds for the purposes of matching ads to their interests, as those interests are deduced from the collateral traces of online behavior. With Google's unique access to behavioral data, it would now be possible to know what a *particular* individual in a particular time and place was thinking, feeling, and doing. That this no longer seems astonishing to us, or perhaps even worthy of note, is evidence of the profound psychic numbing that has inured us to a bold and unprecedented shift in capitalist methods.|Chap 10, Para 53|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
896|10|54|"The techniques described in the patent meant that each time a user queries Google's search engine, the system simultaneously presents a specific configuration of a particular ad, all in the fraction of a moment that it takes to fulfill the search query. The data used to perform this instant translation from query to ad, a predictive analysis that was dubbed ""matching,"" went far beyond the mere denotation of search terms. New data sets were compiled that would dramatically enhance the accuracy of these predictions. These data sets were referred to as ""user profile information"" or ""UPI."" These new data meant that there would be no more guesswork and far less waste in the advertising budget. Mathematical certainty would replace all of that."|Chap 10, Para 54|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
897|10|55|"Where would UPI come from? The scientists announce a breakthrough. They first explain that some of the new data can be culled from the firm's []existing systems with its continuously accruing caches of behavioral data from Search. Then they stress that even more behavioral data can be hunted and herded from anywhere in the online world. UPI, they write, ""may be *inferred,*"" ""*presumed,*"" and ""*deduced.*"" Their new methods and computational tools could create UPI from integrating and analyzing a user's search patterns, document inquiries, and myriad other signals of online behaviors, even when users do not directly provide that personal information: ""User profile information may include any information about an individual user or a group of users. Such information may be provided by the user, provided by a third-party authorized to release user information, *and/or derived from user actions.* Certain user information can be deduced or presumed using other user information of the same user and/or user information of other users. UPI may be associated with various entities."""|Chap 10, Para 55|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
898|10|56|"The inventors explain that UPI can be deduced directly from a user's or group's actions, from any kind of document a user views, or from an ad landing page: ""For example, an ad for prostate cancer screening might be limited to user profiles having the attribute 'male' and 'age 45 and over.'"" They describe different ways to obtain UPI. One relies on ""machine learning classifiers"" that predict values on a range of attributes. ""Association graphs"" are developed to reveal the relationships among users, documents, search queries, and web pages: ""user-to-user associations may also be generated."" The inventors also note that their methods can be understood only among the priesthood of computer scientists drawn to the analytic challenges of this new online universe: ""The following description is presented to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention.... Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art...."""|Chap 10, Para 56|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
899|10|57|"Of critical importance to our story is the scientists' observation that the most challenging sources of friction here are *social,* not technical. Friction arises when users intentionally fail to provide information for no other reason than that they choose not to. ""Unfortunately, user profile information is not always available,"" the scientists warn. Users do not always ""voluntarily"" provide information, or ""the user profile may be incomplete... and hence not comprehensive, *because of privacy considerations,* etc."""|Chap 10, Para 57|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
900|10|58|"A clear aim of the patent is to assure its audience that Google scientists will not be deterred by users' exercise of decision rights over their personal []information, despite the fact that such rights were an inherent feature of the original social contract between the company and its users. Even when users do provide UPI, the inventors caution, ""it may be *intentionally* or unintentionally inaccurate, it may become stale.... UPI for a user... can be determined (or updated or extended) *even when no explicit information is given to the system*.... An initial UPI may include some expressly entered UPI information, *though it doesn't need to.*"""|Chap 10, Para 58|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
901|10|59|The scientists thus make clear that they are willing---and that their inventions are able---to overcome the friction entailed in users' decision rights. Google's proprietary methods enable it to surveil, capture, expand, construct, and claim behavioral surplus, including data that users intentionally choose not to share. Recalcitrant users will not be obstacles to data expropriation. No moral, legal, or social constraints will stand in the way of finding, claiming, and analyzing others' behavior for commercial purposes.|Chap 10, Para 59|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
902|10|60|The inventors provide examples of the kinds of attributes that Google could assess as it compiles its UPI data sets while circumnavigating users' knowledge, intentions, and consent. These include websites visited, psychographics, browsing activity, and information about previous advertisements that the user has been shown, selected, and/or made purchases after viewing. It is a long list that is certainly much longer today.|Chap 10, Para 60|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
903|10|61|"Finally, the inventors observe another obstacle to effective targeting. Even when user information exists, they say, ""Advertisers may not be able to use this information to target ads effectively."" On the strength of the invention presented in this patent, and others related to it, the inventors publicly declare Google's unique prowess in hunting, capturing, and transforming surplus into predictions for accurate targeting. No other firm could equal its range of access to behavioral surplus, its bench strength of scientific knowledge and technique, its computational power, or its storage infrastructure. In 2003 only Google could pull surplus from multiple sites of activity and integrate each increment of data into comprehensive ""data structures."" Google was uniquely positioned with the state-of-the-art knowledge in computer science to convert those data into predictions of who will click on which configuration of what ad as the basis for a final ""matching"" result, all computed in micro-fractions of a second."|Chap 10, Para 61|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
904|10|62|To state all this in plain language, Google's invention revealed new capabilities to infer and deduce the thoughts, feelings, intentions, and interests []of individuals and groups with an automated architecture that operates as a one-way mirror irrespective of a person's awareness, knowledge, and consent, thus enabling privileged secret access to behavioral data.|Chap 10, Para 62|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
905|10|63|A one-way mirror embodies the specific social relations of surveillance based on asymmetries of knowledge and power. The new mode of accumulation invented at Google would derive, above all, from the firm's willingness and ability to impose these social relations on its users. Its willingness was mobilized by what the founders came to regard as a state of exception; its ability came from its actual success in leveraging privileged access to behavioral surplus in order to predict the behavior of individuals now, soon, and later. The predictive insights thus acquired would constitute a world-historic competitive advantage in a new marketplace where low-risk bets about the behavior of individuals are valued, bought, and sold.|Chap 10, Para 63|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
906|10|64|"Google would no longer be a passive recipient of accidental data that it could recycle for the benefit of its users. The targeted advertising patent sheds light on the path of discovery that Google traveled from its advocacy-oriented founding toward the elaboration of behavioral surveillance as a full-blown logic of accumulation. The invention itself exposes the reasoning through which the behavioral value reinvestment cycle was subjugated to the service of a new commercial calculation. Behavioral data, whose value had previously been ""used up"" on improving the quality of Search for users, now became the pivotal---and exclusive to Google---raw material for the construction of a dynamic online advertising marketplace. Google would now secure more behavioral data than it needed to serve its users. That surplus, a behavioral surplus, was the game-changing, zero-cost asset that was diverted from service improvement toward a genuine and highly lucrative market exchange."|Chap 10, Para 64|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
907|10|65|These capabilities were and remain inscrutable to all but an exclusive data priesthood among whom Google is the *übermensch.* They operate in obscurity, indifferent to social norms or individual claims to self-determining decision rights. These moves established the foundational mechanisms of surveillance capitalism.|Chap 10, Para 65|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
908|10|66|The state of exception declared by Google's founders transformed the youthful Dr. Jekyll into a ruthless, muscular Mr. Hyde determined to hunt his prey anywhere, anytime, irrespective of others' self-determining aims. The new Google ignored claims to self-determination and acknowledged []no a priori limits on what it could find and take. It dismissed the moral and legal content of individual decision rights and recast the situation as one of technological opportunism and unilateral power. This new Google assures its actual customers that it will do whatever it takes to transform the natural obscurity of human desire into scientific fact. This Google is the superpower that establishes its own values and pursues its own purposes above and beyond the social contracts to which others are bound.|Chap 10, Para 66|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
909|10|67|"There were other new elements that helped to establish the centrality of behavioral surplus in Google's commercial operations, beginning with its pricing innovations. The first new pricing metric was based on ""click-through rates,"" or how many times a user clicks on an ad through to the advertiser's web page, rather than pricing based on the number of views that an ad receives. The click-through was interpreted as a signal of relevance and therefore a measure of successful targeting, operational results that derive from and reflect the value of behavioral surplus."|Chap 10, Para 67|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
910|10|68|"This new pricing discipline established an ever-escalating incentive to increase behavioral surplus in order to continuously upgrade the effectiveness of predictions. Better predictions lead directly to more click-throughs and thus to revenue. Google learned new ways to conduct automated auctions for ad targeting that allowed the new invention to scale quickly, accommodating hundreds of thousands of advertisers and billions (later it would be trillions) of auctions simultaneously. Google's unique auction methods and capabilities earned a great deal of attention, which distracted observers from reflecting on exactly what was being auctioned: *derivatives of behavioral surplus*. Click-through metrics institutionalized ""customer"" demand for these prediction products and thus established the central importance of *economies of scale in surplus supply operations*. Surplus capture would have to become automatic and ubiquitous if the new logic was to succeed, as measured by the successful trading of behavioral futures."|Chap 10, Para 68|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
911|10|69|"Another key metric called the ""quality score"" helped determine the price of an ad and its specific position on the page, in addition to advertisers' own []auction bids. The quality score was determined in part by click-through rates and in part by the firm's analyses of behavioral surplus. ""The clickthrough rate needed to be a *predictive* thing,"" one top executive insisted, and that would require ""all the information we had about the query right then."" It would take enormous computing power and leading-edge algorithmic programs to produce powerful predictions of user behavior that became the criteria for estimating the relevance of an ad. Ads that scored high would sell at a lower price than those that scored poorly. Google's customers, its advertisers, complained that the quality score was a black box, and Google was determined to keep it so. Nonetheless, when customers followed its disciplines and produced high-scoring ads, their click-through rates soared."|Chap 10, Para 69|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
912|10|70|"AdWords quickly became so successful that it inspired significant expansion of the surveillance logic. Advertisers demanded more clicks. The answer was to extend the model beyond Google's search pages and convert the entire internet into a canvas for Google's targeted ads. This required turning Google's newfound skills at ""data extraction and analysis,"" as Hal Varian put it, toward the content of any web page or user action by employing Google's rapidly expanding semantic analysis and artificial intelligence capabilities to efficiently ""squeeze"" meaning from them. Only then could Google accurately assess the content of a page and how users interact with that content. This ""content-targeted advertising"" based on Google's patented methods was eventually named AdSense. By 2004, AdSense had achieved a run rate of a million dollars per day, and by 2010, it produced annual revenues of more than \$10 billion."|Chap 10, Para 70|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
913|10|71|"So here was an unprecedented and lucrative brew: behavioral surplus, data science, material infrastructure, computational power, algorithmic systems, and automated platforms. This convergence produced unprecedented ""relevance"" and billions of auctions. Click-through rates skyrocketed. Work on AdWords and AdSense became just as important as work on Search."|Chap 10, Para 71|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
914|10|72|"With click-through rates as the measure of relevance accomplished, behavioral surplus was institutionalized as the cornerstone of a new kind of commerce that depended upon online surveillance at scale. Insiders referred to Google's new science of behavioral prediction as the ""physics of clicks."" Mastery of this new domain required a specialized breed of click physicists who would secure Google's preeminence within the nascent priesthood of []behavioral prediction. The firm's substantial revenue flows summoned the greatest minds of our age from fields such as artificial intelligence, statistics, machine learning, data science, and predictive analytics to converge on the prediction of human behavior as measured by click-through rates: computer-mediated fortune-telling and selling. The firm would recruit an authority on information economics, and consultant to Google since 2001, as the patriarch of this auspicious group and the still-young science: Hal Varian was the chosen shepherd of this flock."|Chap 10, Para 72|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE

Page was haunted by the example of the brilliant but impoverished scientist Nikola Tesla, who died without ever benefiting financially from his inventions.

Exceptional threats to their financial and social status appear to have awakened a survival instinct in Page and Brin that required exceptional adaptive measures.

916|10|74|"Later, Sequoia's Moritz recalled the crisis conditions that provoked the firm's ""ingenious"" self-reinvention, when crisis opened a fork in the road and drew the company in a wholly new direction. He stressed the specificity of Google's inventions, their origins in emergency, and the 180-degree turn from serving users to surveilling them. Most of all, he credited the discovery of behavioral surplus as the game-changing asset that turned Google into a fortune-telling giant, pinpointing Google's breakthrough transformation of the Overture model, when the young company first applied its analytics of behavioral surplus to predict the likelihood of a click:"|Chap 10, Para 74|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE

At first it went in a different direction, which was selling its technology---selling licenses for its search engines to larger internet properties and to corporations.... Cash was going out of the window at a feral rate during the first six, seven months. And then, very ingeniously, Larry... and Sergey... and others fastened on a model that they had seen this other company, Overture, develop, which was ranked advertisements. They saw how it could be improved and enhanced and made it their own, and that transformed the business. :::|Chap 10, Para 75|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
918|10|76|"Moritz's reflections suggest that without the discovery of behavioral surplus and the turn toward surveillance operations, Google's ""feral"" rate of spending was not sustainable and the firm's survival was imperiled. We will never know what Google might have made of itself without the state of exception fueled by the emergency of impatient money that shaped those crucial years of development. What other pathways to sustainable revenue might have been explored or invented? What alternative futures might have been summoned to keep faith with the founders' principles and with their users' rights to self-determination? Instead, Google loosed a new incarnation of capitalism upon the world, a Pandora's box whose contents we are only beginning to understand."|Chap 10, Para 76|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
919|10|77|Key to our conversation is this fact: surveillance capitalism was invented by a specific group of human beings in a specific time and place. It is not an inherent result of digital technology, nor is it a necessary expression of information capitalism. It was intentionally constructed at a moment in history, in much the same way that the engineers and tinkerers at the Ford Motor Company invented mass production in the Detroit of 1913.|Chap 10, Para 77|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
920|10|78|Henry Ford set out to prove that he could maximize profits by driving up volumes, radically decreasing costs, and widening demand. It was []an unproven commercial equation for which no economic theory or body of practice existed. Fragments of the formula had surfaced before---in meatpacking plants, flour-milling operations, sewing machine and bicycle factories, armories, canneries, and breweries. There was a growing body of practical knowledge about the interchangeability of parts and absolute standardization, precision machines, and continuous flow production. But no one had achieved the grand symphony that Ford heard in his imagination.|Chap 10, Para 78|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
921|10|79|"As historian David Hounshell tells it, there was a time, April 1, 1913, and a place, Detroit, when the first moving assembly line seemed to be ""just another step in the years of development at Ford yet somehow suddenly dropped out of the sky. Even before the end of the day, some of the engineers sensed that they had made a fundamental breakthrough."" Within a year, productivity increases across the plant ranged from 50 percent to as much as ten times the output of the old fixed-assembly methods. The Model T that sold for \$825 in 1908 was priced at a record low for a four-cylinder automobile in 1924, just \$260."|Chap 10, Para 79|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
922|10|80|"Much as with Ford, some elements of the economic surveillance logic in the online environment had been operational for years, familiar only to a rarefied group of early computer experts. For example, the software mechanism known as the ""cookie""---bits of code that allow information to be passed between a server and a client computer---was developed in 1994 at Netscape, the first commercial web browser company. Similarly, ""web bugs""---tiny (often invisible) graphics embedded in web pages and e-mail and designed to monitor user activity and collect personal information---were well-known to experts in the late 1990s."|Chap 10, Para 80|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
923|10|81|"These experts were deeply concerned about the privacy implications of such monitoring mechanisms, and at least in the case of cookies, there were institutional efforts to design internet policies that would prohibit their invasive capabilities to monitor and profile users. By 1996, the function of cookies had become a contested public policy issue. Federal Trade Commission workshops in 1996 and 1997 discussed proposals that would assign control of all personal information to users by default with a simple automated protocol. Advertisers bitterly contested this scheme, collaborating instead to avert government regulation by forming a ""self-regulating"" association known as []the Network Advertising Initiative. Still, in June 2000 the Clinton administration banned cookies from all federal websites, and by April 2001, three bills before Congress included provisions to regulate cookies."|Chap 10, Para 81|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
924|10|82|Google brought new life to these practices. As had occurred at Ford a century earlier, the company's engineers and scientists were the first to conduct the entire commercial surveillance symphony, integrating a wide range of mechanisms from cookies to proprietary analytics and algorithmic software capabilities in a sweeping new logic that enshrined surveillance and the unilateral expropriation of behavioral data as the basis for a new market form. The impact of this invention was just as dramatic as Ford's. In 2001, as Google's new systems to exploit its discovery of behavioral surplus were being tested, net revenues jumped to \$86 million (more than a 400 percent increase over 2000), and the company turned its first profit. By 2002, the cash began to flow and has never stopped, definitive evidence that behavioral surplus combined with Google's proprietary analytics were sending arrows to their marks. Revenues leapt to \$347 million in 2002, then \$1.5 billion in 2003, and \$3.5 billion in 2004, the year the company went public. The discovery of behavioral surplus had produced a stunning 3,590 percent increase in revenue in less than four years.|Chap 10, Para 82|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
925|10|83|It is important to note the vital differences for capitalism in these two moments of originality at Ford and Google. Ford's inventions revolutionized *production*. Google's inventions revolutionized *extraction* and established surveillance capitalism's first economic imperative: the *extraction imperative*. The extraction imperative meant that raw-material supplies must be procured at an ever-expanding scale. Industrial capitalism had demanded economies of scale in production in order to achieve high throughput combined with low unit cost. In contrast, surveillance capitalism demands economies of scale in the extraction of behavioral surplus.|Chap 10, Para 83|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
926|10|84|"Mass production was aimed at new sources of demand in the early twentieth century's first mass consumers. Ford was clear on this point: ""Mass production begins in the perception of a public need."" Supply and demand []were linked effects of the new ""conditions of existence"" that defined the lives of my great-grandparents Sophie and Max and other travelers in the first modernity. Ford's invention deepened the reciprocities between capitalism and these populations."|Chap 10, Para 84|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
927|10|85|In contrast, Google's inventions destroyed the reciprocities of its original social contract with users. The role of the behavioral value reinvestment cycle that had once aligned Google with its users changed dramatically. Instead of deepening the unity of supply and demand with its populations, Google chose to reinvent its business around the burgeoning demand of advertisers eager to squeeze and scrape online behavior by any available means in the competition for market advantage. In the new operation, *users were no longer ends in themselves but rather became the means to others' ends.*|Chap 10, Para 85|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
928|10|86|Reinvestment in user services became the method for attracting behavioral surplus, and users became the unwitting suppliers of raw material for a larger cycle of revenue generation. The scale of surplus expropriation that was possible at Google would soon eliminate all serious competitors to its core search business as the windfall earnings from leveraging behavioral surplus were used to continuously draw more users into its net, thus establishing its de facto monopoly in Search. On the strength of Google's inventions, discoveries, and strategies, it became the mother ship and ideal type of a new economic logic based on fortune-telling and selling---an ancient and eternally lucrative craft that has fed on humanity's confrontation with uncertainty from the beginning of the human story.|Chap 10, Para 86|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
929|10|87|It was one thing to proselytize achievements in production, as Henry Ford had done, but quite another to boast about the continuous intensification of hidden processes aimed at the extraction of behavioral data and personal information. The last thing that Google wanted was to reveal the secrets of how it had rewritten its own rules and, in the process, enslaved itself to the extraction imperative. Behavioral surplus was necessary for revenue, and secrecy would be necessary for the sustained accumulation of behavioral surplus.|Chap 10, Para 87|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
930|10|88|"This is how secrecy came to be institutionalized in the policies and practices that govern every aspect of Google's behavior onstage and offstage. Once Google's leadership understood the commercial power of behavioral surplus, Schmidt instituted what he called the ""hiding strategy."" Google employees []were told not to speak about what the patent had referred to as its ""novel methods, apparatus, message formats and/or data structures"" or confirm any rumors about flowing cash. Hiding was not a post hoc strategy; it was baked into the cake that would become surveillance capitalism."|Chap 10, Para 88|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
931|10|89|"Former Google executive Douglas Edwards writes compellingly about this predicament and the culture of secrecy it shaped. According to his account, Page and Brin were ""hawks,"" insisting on aggressive data capture and retention: ""Larry opposed any path that would reveal our technological secrets or stir the privacy pot and endanger our ability to gather data."" Page wanted to avoid arousing users' curiosity by minimizing their exposure to any clues about the reach of the firm's data operations. He questioned the prudence of the electronic scroll in the reception lobby that displays a continuous stream of search queries, and he ""tried to kill"" the annual Google Zeitgeist conference that summarizes the year's trends in search terms."|Chap 10, Para 89|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
932|10|90|"Journalist John Battelle, who chronicled Google during the 2002--2004 period, described the company's ""aloofness,"" ""limited information sharing,"" and ""alienating and unnecessary secrecy and isolation."" Another early company biographer notes, ""What made this information easier to keep is that almost none of the experts tracking the business of the internet believed that Google's secret was even possible."" As Schmidt told the *New York Times,* ""You need to win, but you are better off winning softly."" The scientific and material complexity that supported the capture and analysis of behavioral surplus also enabled the hiding strategy, an invisibility cloak over the whole operation. ""Managing search at our scale is a very serious barrier to entry,"" Schmidt warned would-be competitors."|Chap 10, Para 90|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
933|10|91|To be sure, there are always sound business reasons for hiding the location of your gold mine. In Google's case, the hiding strategy accrued to its competitive advantage, but there were other reasons for concealment and obfuscation. What might the response have been back then if the public were told that Google's magic derived from its exclusive capabilities in unilateral surveillance of online behavior and its methods specifically designed to override individual decision rights? Google policies had to enforce secrecy in order to protect operations that were designed to be undetectable because they took things from users without asking and employed those unilaterally claimed resources to work in the service of others' purposes.|Chap 10, Para 91|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
934|10|92|"[]That Google had the power to choose secrecy is itself testament to the success of its own claims. This power is a crucial illustration of the difference between ""decision rights"" and ""privacy."" Decision rights confer the power to choose whether to keep something secret or to share it. One can choose the degree of privacy or transparency for each situation. US Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas articulated this view of privacy in 1967: ""Privacy involves the choice of the individual to disclose or to reveal what he believes, what he thinks, what he possesses...."""|Chap 10, Para 92|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
935|10|93|Surveillance capitalism lays claim to these decision rights. The typical complaint is that privacy is eroded, but that is misleading. In the larger societal pattern, privacy is not eroded but redistributed, as decision rights over privacy are claimed for surveillance capital. Instead of people having the rights to decide how and what they will disclose, these rights are concentrated within the domain of surveillance capitalism. Google discovered this necessary element of the new logic of accumulation: it must assert the rights to take the information upon which its success depends.|Chap 10, Para 93|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
936|10|94|"The corporation's ability to hide this rights grab depends on language as much as it does on technical methods or corporate policies of secrecy. George Orwell once observed that euphemisms are used in politics, war, and business as instruments that ""make lies sound truthful and murder respectable."" Google has been careful to camouflage the significance of its behavioral surplus operations in industry jargon. Two popular terms---""digital exhaust"" and ""digital breadcrumbs""---connote worthless waste: leftovers lying around for the taking. Why allow exhaust to drift in the atmosphere when it can be recycled into useful data? Who would think to call such recycling an act of exploitation, expropriation, or plunder? Who would dare to redefine ""digital exhaust"" as booty or contraband, or imagine that Google had learned how to purposefully construct that so-called ""exhaust"" with its methods, apparatus, and data structures?"|Chap 10, Para 94|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
937|10|95|"The word ""targeted"" is another euphemism. It evokes notions of precision, efficiency, and competence. Who would guess that targeting conceals a new political equation in which Google's concentrations of computational power brush aside users' decision rights as easily as King Kong might shoo away an ant, all accomplished offstage where no one can see?"|Chap 10, Para 95|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
938|10|96|"These euphemisms operate in exactly the same way as those found on the earliest maps of the North American continent, in which whole regions []were labeled with terms such as ""heathens,"" ""infidels,"" ""idolaters,"" ""primitives,"" ""vassals,"" and ""rebels."" On the strength of those euphemisms, native peoples---their places and claims---were deleted from the invaders' moral and legal equations, legitimating the acts of taking and breaking that paved the way for church and monarchy."|Chap 10, Para 96|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
939|10|97|"The intentional work of hiding naked facts in rhetoric, omission, complexity, exclusivity, scale, abusive contracts, design, and euphemism is another factor that helps explain why during Google's breakthrough to profitability, few noticed the foundational mechanisms of its success and their larger significance. In this picture, commercial surveillance is not merely an unfortunate accident or occasional lapse. It is neither a necessary development of information capitalism nor a necessary product of digital technology or the internet. It is a specifically constructed human choice, an unprecedented market form, an original solution to emergency, and the underlying mechanism through which a new asset class is created on the cheap and converted to revenue. Surveillance is the path to profit that overrides ""we the people,"" taking our decision rights without permission and even when we say ""no."" The discovery of behavioral surplus marks a critical turning point not only in Google's biography but also in the history of capitalism."|Chap 10, Para 97|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
940|10|98|In the years following its IPO in 2004, Google's spectacular financial breakthrough first astonished and then magnetized the online world. Silicon Valley investors had doubled down on risk for years, in search of that elusive business model that would make it all worthwhile. When Google's financial results went public, the hunt for mythic treasure was officially over.|Chap 10, Para 98|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
941|10|99|"The new logic of accumulation spread first to Facebook, which launched the same year that Google went public. CEO Mark Zuckerberg had rejected the strategy of charging users a fee for service as the telephone companies had done in an earlier century. ""Our mission is to connect every person in the world. You don't do that by having a service people pay for,"" he insisted. In May 2007 he introduced the Facebook platform, opening up the social network to everyone, not just people with a college e-mail address. Six months later, in November, he launched his big advertising product, Beacon, which would automatically share transactions from partner websites with all of a user's ""friends."" These posts would appear even if the user was not currently []logged into Facebook, without the user's knowledge or an opt-in function. The howls of protest---from users but also from some of Facebook's partners such as Coca-Cola---forced Zuckerberg to back down swiftly. By December, Beacon became an opt-in program. The twenty-three-year-old CEO understood the potential of surveillance capitalism, but he had not yet mastered Google's facility in obscuring its operations and intent."|Chap 10, Para 99|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
942|10|100|"The pressing question in Facebook's headquarters---""How do we turn all those Facebook users into money?""---still required an answer. In March 2008, just three months after having to kill his first attempt at emulating Google's logic of accumulation, Zuckerberg hired Google executive Sheryl Sandberg to be Facebook's chief operating officer. The onetime chief of staff to US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Sandberg had joined Google in 2001, ultimately rising to be its vice president of global online sales and operations. At Google she led the development of surveillance capitalism through the expansion of AdWords and other aspects of online sales operations. One investor who had observed the company's growth during that period concluded, ""Sheryl created AdWords."""|Chap 10, Para 100|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
943|10|101|"In signing on with Facebook, the talented Sandberg became the ""Typhoid Mary"" of surveillance capitalism as she led Facebook's transformation from a social networking site to an advertising behemoth. Sandberg understood that Facebook's social graph represented an awe-inspiring source of behavioral surplus: the extractor's equivalent of a nineteenth-century prospector stumbling into a valley that sheltered the largest diamond mine *and* the deepest gold mine ever to be discovered. ""We have better information than anyone else. We know gender, age, location, and it's real data as opposed to the stuff other people infer,"" Sandberg said. Facebook would learn to track, scrape, store, and analyze UPI to fabricate its own targeting algorithms, and like Google it would not restrict extraction operations to what people voluntarily shared with the company. Sandberg understood that through the artful manipulation of Facebook's culture of intimacy and sharing, it would be possible to use behavioral surplus not only to satisfy demand but also to *create* demand. For starters, that meant inserting advertisers into the fabric of Facebook's online culture, where they could ""invite"" users into a ""conversation."""|Chap 10, Para 101|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
944|10|102|With Google in the lead, surveillance capitalism rapidly became the default model of information capitalism on the web and, as we shall see new market form declares that serving the genuine needs of people is less lucrative, and therefore less important, than selling predictions of their behavior.

945|10|103|Behavioral surplus defines Google's earnings success. In 2016, 89 percent of the revenues of its parent company, Alphabet, derived from Google's targeted advertising programs.

946|10|104|On the strength of its unprecedented inventions, Google's \$400 billion market value edged out ExxonMobil for the number-two spot in market capitalization in 2014, only sixteen years after its founding, making it the second-richest company in the world behind Apple.

947|10|105|It is useful to stand back from this complexity to grasp the overall pattern and how the puzzle pieces fit together:|Chap 10, Para 105|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
948|10|106|"1\. ***The logic:*** Google and other surveillance platforms are sometimes described as ""two-sided"" or ""multi-sided"" markets, but the mechanisms of surveillance capitalism suggest something different. Google had discovered a way to translate its nonmarket interactions with users into surplus raw material for the fabrication of products aimed at genuine market transactions with its real customers: advertisers. The translation of behavioral surplus from outside to inside the market finally enabled Google to convert investment into revenue. The corporation thus created out of thin air and at zero marginal cost an asset class of vital raw materials derived from users' nonmarket online behavior. At first those raw materials were simply ""found,"" []a by-product of users' search actions. Later those assets were hunted aggressively and procured largely through surveillance. The corporation simultaneously created a new kind of marketplace in which its proprietary ""prediction products"" manufactured from these raw materials could be bought and sold."|Chap 10, Para 106|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
949|10|107|"The summary of these developments is that the behavioral surplus upon which Google's fortune rests can be considered as *surveillance assets.* These assets are critical raw materials in the pursuit of *surveillance revenues* and their translation into *surveillance capital.* The entire logic of this capital accumulation is most accurately understood as *surveillance capitalism*, which is the foundational framework for a surveillance-based economic order: a *surveillance economy*. The big pattern here is one of subordination and hierarchy, in which earlier reciprocities between the firm and its users are subordinated to the derivative project of our behavioral surplus captured for others' aims. We are no longer the *subjects* of value realization. Nor are we, as some have insisted, the ""product"" of Google's sales. Instead, we are the *objects* from which raw materials are extracted and expropriated for Google's prediction factories. Predictions about our behavior are Google's products, and they are sold to its actual customers but not to us. *We are the means to others' ends.*"|Chap 10, Para 107|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
950|10|108|Industrial capitalism transformed nature's raw materials into commodities, and surveillance capitalism lays its claims to the stuff of human nature for a new commodity invention. Now it is human nature that is scraped, torn, and taken for another century's market project. It is obscene to suppose that this harm can be reduced to the obvious fact that users receive no fee for the raw material they supply. That critique is a feat of misdirection that would use a pricing mechanism to institutionalize and therefore legitimate the extraction of human behavior for manufacturing and sale. It ignores the key point that the essence of the exploitation here is the rendering of our lives as behavioral data for the sake of others' improved control of us. The remarkable questions here concern the facts that our lives are rendered as behavioral data in the first place; that ignorance is a condition of this ubiquitous rendition; that decision rights vanish before one even knows that there is a decision to make; that there are consequences to this diminishment of rights that we can neither see nor foretell; that there is no exit, no voice, and no loyalty, only helplessness, resignation, and psychic numbing; and that encryption is []the only positive action left to discuss when we sit around the dinner table and casually ponder how to hide from the forces that hide from us.|Chap 10, Para 108|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
951|10|109|"2\. ***The means of production:*** Google's internet-age manufacturing process is a critical component of the unprecedented. Its specific technologies and techniques, which I summarize as ""machine intelligence,"" are constantly evolving, and it is easy to be intimidated by their complexity. The same term may mean one thing today and something very different in one year or in five years. For example, Google has been described as developing and deploying ""artificial intelligence"" since at least 2003, but the term itself is a moving target, as capabilities have evolved from primitive programs that can play tic-tac-toe to systems that can operate whole fleets of driverless cars."|Chap 10, Para 109|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
952|10|110|Google's machine intelligence capabilities feed on behavioral surplus, and the more surplus they consume, the more accurate the prediction products that result. *Wired* magazine's founding editor, Kevin Kelly, once suggested that although it seems like Google is committed to developing its artificial intelligence capabilities to improve Search, it's more likely that Google develops Search as a means of continuously training its evolving AI capabilities. This is the essence of the machine intelligence project. As the ultimate tapeworm, the machine's intelligence depends upon how much data it eats. In this important respect the new means of production differs fundamentally from the industrial model, in which there is a tension between quantity and quality. Machine intelligence is the synthesis of this tension, for it reaches its full potential for quality only as it approximates totality.|Chap 10, Para 110|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
953|10|111|"As more companies chase Google-style surveillance profits, a significant fraction of global genius in data science and related fields is dedicated to the fabrication of prediction products that increase click-through rates for targeted advertising. For example, Chinese researchers employed by Microsoft's Bing's research unit in Beijing published breakthrough findings in 2017. ""Accurately estimating the click-through rate (CTR) of ads has a vital impact on the revenue of search businesses; even a 0.1% accuracy improvement in our production would yield hundreds of millions of dollars in additional earnings,"" they begin. They go on to demonstrate a new application of advanced neural networks that promises 0.9 percent improvement on one measure of identification and ""significant click yield gains in online traffic."" Similarly, a team of Google researchers introduced a new deep-neural network model, []all for the sake of capturing ""predictive feature interactions"" and delivering ""state-of-the-art performance"" to improve click-through rates. Thousands of contributions like these, some incremental and some dramatic, equate to an expensive, sophisticated, opaque, and exclusive *twenty-first-century ""means of production.""*"|Chap 10, Para 111|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
954|10|112|3\. ***The products:*** Machine intelligence processes behavioral surplus into *prediction products* designed to forecast what we will feel, think, and do: now, soon, and later. These methodologies are among Google's most closely guarded secrets. The nature of its products explains why Google repeatedly claims that it does not sell personal data. What? Never! Google executives like to claim their privacy purity because they do not sell their raw material. Instead, the company sells the predictions that only it can fabricate from its world-historic private hoard of behavioral surplus.|Chap 10, Para 112|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
955|10|113|Prediction products reduce risks for customers, advising them where and when to place their bets. The quality and competitiveness of the product are a function of its approximation to certainty: the more predictive the product, the lower the risks for buyers and the greater the volume of sales. Google has learned to be a data-based fortune-teller that replaces intuition with science at scale in order to tell and sell our fortunes for profit to its customers, but not to us. Early on, Google's prediction products were largely aimed at sales of targeted advertising, but as we shall see, advertising was the beginning of the surveillance project, not the end.|Chap 10, Para 113|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE
956|10|114|4\. ***The marketplace:*** Prediction products are sold into a new kind of market that trades exclusively in future behavior. Surveillance capitalism's profits derive primarily from these *behavioral futures markets.* Although advertisers were the dominant players in the early history of this new kind of marketplace, there is no reason why such markets are limited to this group. The new prediction systems are only incidentally about ads, in the same way that Ford's new system of mass production was only incidentally about automobiles. In both cases the systems can be applied to many other domains. The already visible trend, as we shall see in the coming chapters, is that any actor with an interest in purchasing probabilistic information about our behavior and/or influencing future behavior can pay to play in markets where the behavioral fortunes of individuals, groups, bodies, and things are told and sold (see [Figure 2](chapter006.xhtml#fig2)). ::: :::  :::  []![Book Title Page](images/Art_P97.jpg)|Chap 10, Para 114|10 THE RIGHT TO THE FUTURE TENSE

In the drive to fulfill this ambition, the extraction imperative produces a relentless push for scale in supply operations. There can be no boundaries that limit scale in the hunt for behavioral surplus, no territory exempted from plunder. The assertion of decision rights over the expropriation of human experience, its translation into data, and the uses of those data are collateral to this process, inseparable as a shadow. This explains why Google's supply chains began with Search but steadily expanded to encompass new and even-more-ambitious territories far from clicks and queries. Google's stores of behavioral surplus now embrace everything in the online milieu: searches, e-mails, texts, photos, songs, messages, videos, locations, communication patterns, attitudes, preferences, interests, faces, emotions, illnesses, social networks, purchases, and so on. A []new continent of behavioral surplus is spun each moment from the many virtual threads of our everyday lives as they collide with Google, Facebook, and, more generally, every aspect of the internet's computer-mediated architecture. Indeed, under the direction of surveillance capitalism the global reach of computer mediation is repurposed as an *extraction architecture.*"|Chap 11, Para 2|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
960|11|3|This process originated online but has spread to the real world as well, a fact that we will examine more closely in Part II. If Google is a search company, why is it investing in smart-home devices, wearables, and self-driving cars? If Facebook is a social network, why is it developing drones and augmented reality? This diversity sometimes confounds observers but is generally applauded as visionary investment: far-out bets on the future. In fact, activities that appear to be varied and even scattershot across a random selection of industries and projects are actually all the same activity guided by the same aim: behavioral surplus capture. Each is a slightly different configuration of hardware, software, algorithms, sensors, and connectivity designed to mimic a car, shirt, cell phone, book, video, robot, chip, drone, camera, cornea, tree, television, watch, nanobot, intestinal flora, or any online service, but they all share the same purpose: behavioral surplus capture.|Chap 11, Para 3|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
961|11|4|"Google is a shape-shifter, but each shape harbors the same aim: to hunt and capture raw material. *Baby, won't you ride my car? Talk to my phone? Wear my shirt? Use my map?* In all these cases the varied torrent of creative shapes is the sideshow to the main event: the continuous expansion of the extraction architecture to acquire raw material at scale to feed an expensive production process that makes prediction products that attract and retain more customers. When confronted in 2008 with a question about why Google had 150 ""products,"" its CEO, Eric Schmidt, responded: ""That can be stated as criticism, but it can also be stated as strategy. The goal of the company is customer satisfaction. You should think of Google as one product: customer satisfaction."" Those customers are the world's advertisers and others who pay for its predictions. ""Customer satisfaction"" therefore equates to Google's dominant market share in lucrative new behavioral futures markets, fed by its ever-expanding extraction architecture."|Chap 11, Para 4|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
962|11|5|New supply routes are continuously constructed and tested, and only some go operational. Routes that reliably produce scale, such as the Android smartphone operating system or Gmail, are elaborated and institutionalized. []Those that fail are shuttered or modified. If one route is blocked, another is found. Successful supply routes double as canvases for targeted advertising, expanding the reach of behavioral futures markets and simultaneously engaging users in ways that yield yet more behavioral surplus. There will always be a changing roster of supply routes, but all variations share the same operational mandate: the capture of behavioral surplus and the acquisition of decision rights. Like a river running to the sea, if one route is blocked, another is found.|Chap 11, Para 5|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
963|11|6|In this chapter we follow the consequences of the extraction imperative as it drives the elaboration of the new market form and its competitive dynamics. The imperative elevates surplus supply operations to a defining role in every aspect of the surveillance capitalist enterprise. This begins with a continuous parade of innovations aimed at cornering raw-material supplies. Cornering is not simply a technological achievement. Sustainable dispossession requires a highly orchestrated and carefully phased amalgam of political, communicative, administrative, legal, and material strategies that audaciously asserts and tirelessly defends claims to new ground. The success of these strategies, first at Google and later at Facebook, established both their feasibility and their rewards, drawing new competitors into an increasingly ruthless cycle of kidnapping human experience, cornering surplus supplies, and competing in new behavioral futures markets.|Chap 11, Para 6|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
964|11|7|"The discovery of behavioral surplus in 2001--2002 meant that Google Search would be the first Google ""service"" to be re-crafted as a supply route. The resulting shifts in the mechanisms of Search were nearly impossible for people to imagine, let alone detect. When Harvard Business School's Benjamin Edelman researched these hidden mechanisms in 2010, he found that the ""enhanced features"" option of a product called Google Toolbar---a plug-in for Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser that lets users search without having to go to google.com---transmits to the company ""the full URL of every page view, including searches at competing search engines."" Edelman discovered that it was ""strikingly easy"" to activate this option but impossible []to disable it. Even when a user specifically instructed that the toolbar be disabled, and even when it appeared to be disabled because it had disappeared from view, the toolbar continued to track browsing behavior. As Google now hosts ""trillions"" of searches annually, its varied search-related tracking mechanisms combined with its robust and nearly inescapable cookies (bits of tracking code inserted in your computer) ensure immense economies of scale that constitute the bedrock of Google's supply operations. ::: :::  :::  []![Book Title Page](images/Art_P131.jpg)"|Chap 11, Para 7|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
965|11|8|"[]**Figure 3:** The Dynamic of Behavioral Surplus Accumulation ::: ::: :::  In 2015 internet legal scholar Tim Wu joined Harvard Business School's Michael Luca and a team of data scientists from Yelp to research hidden mechanisms in Google Search that function, from our perspective, to expand crucial supply functions. They discovered that Google was systematically corrupting Search results to favor its own content and ""downstream products"":"|Chap 11, Para 8|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
966|11|9|":::  Google has begun to develop its own content over time, such as its own price results for shopping and its own reviews for local businesses.... Google is acting both as a search engine and a content provider. To use its search dominance to promote this content, Google has developed a feature called ""universal search,"" through which it intentionally excludes content competitors and only shows Google's content. :::"|Chap 11, Para 9|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
967|11|10|"The ceaseless requirement for surplus at scale predicts corporate behavior that favors exclusivity. Because Search is the foundation of Google's supply operations, the company has every incentive to entice users to its Search platform, content, and ancillary services and then to use its backstage ""methods, apparatus, and data structures"" for efficient extraction. The tilt toward exclusivity produces a range of practices considered ""monopolistic"" in the perspective of twentieth-century regulatory frameworks. These characterizations, while valid, omit the most-salient elements of the new order. The extraction imperative demands that everything be possessed. In this new context, goods and services are merely surveillance-bound supply routes. It's not the car; it's the behavioral data from driving the car. It's not the map; it's the behavioral data from interacting with the map. The ideal here is continuously expanding borders that eventually describe the world and everything in it, all the time."|Chap 11, Para 10|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
968|11|11|[]Traditionally, monopolies on goods and services disfigure markets by unfairly eliminating competition in order to raise prices at will. Under surveillance capitalism, however, many of the practices defined as monopolistic actually function as means of *cornering* user-derived raw-material supplies. There is no monetary price for the user to pay, only an opportunity for the company to extract data. Cornering practices are not designed to protect product niches but rather to protect critical supply routes for the unregulated commodity that is behavioral surplus. In another time, rogue market actors might corner markets in copper or magnesium, but in our time it is behavioral surplus. The corporation unfairly impedes competitors in Search in order to protect the dominance of its most important supply route, not primarily to fix prices.|Chap 11, Para 11|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
969|11|12|"These cornering operations are not abstractions, with distant effects on minerals or crops that eventually wind their way toward the price of goods. In this picture it is we who are ""cornered."" We are the source of the coveted commodity; our experience is the target of extraction. As surveillance capitalism migrates from Silicon Valley to a range of other ""cornered"" by converging, overlapping, and relentlessly expanding dispossession operations. It is important to say---and we will revisit this theme more than once---that regulatory interventions designed to constrain Google's monopoly practices are likely to have little effect on the fundamental operations of this market form. New supply routes are continuously discovered, opened, and secured. Dispossession activities are compelled to circumvent every obstacle and will continue to do so, short of a genuine existential threat."|Chap 11, Para 12|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
970|11|13|"Google's Android mobile platform offers an example of the governing role of surplus capture and defense. Internet use went mobile with the rise of the smartphone and the tablet, and Google was forced to find new ways to defend and expand its primary supply chain in Search. Android quickly became the corporation's second critical supply route for behavioral surplus. In 2008 Google led an alliance of technology manufacturers and wireless operators to develop an ""open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices."" Some observers thought that an Android phone was Google's opportunity to compete with Apple for the lucrative margins on smartphones, but Google insiders had grasped the even greater potential for growth and profit through behavioral surplus and its fabrication into prediction products."|Chap 11, Para 13|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
971|11|14|"[]Google licensed Android to mobile handset makers for free because it was intended to draw users into Google Search and other Google services, establishing a ubiquitous mobile supply apparatus to sustain known terrains of behavioral surplus and open up new ones, including geolocation and mobile payment systems that are highly coveted by advertisers. As Google's chief financial officer told financial analysts in 2009, ""If we move forward the adoption of these mobile phones by lowering the cost because it is open source, think of how many searches \[that will produce\]."" A prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist described Android devices in 2011 as"|Chap 11, Para 14|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
972|11|15|":::  not ""products"" in the classic business sense... they are not trying to make a profit on Android.... They want to take any layer that lives between themselves and the consumer and make it free (or even less than free).... In essence, they are not just building a moat; Google is also scorching the earth for 250 miles around the outside of the castle to ensure no one can approach it. :::"|Chap 11, Para 15|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
973|11|16|"Supply operations were the protected treasure within the fortified castle, and Android's development policies were key to the success of this supply strategy. Unlike the iPhone, the Android platform was ""open source,"" which made it easy for applications developers around the world to create apps for Android users. Eventually, Google bundled this valuable new universe of apps into its Google Play store. Manufacturers who wanted to preinstall Google Play on their devices were required to license and install Google's mobile services as exclusive or default capabilities: Search, Gmail, Google Pay, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Photos, and whatever other supply routes happen to be in ascendance at the time."|Chap 11, Para 16|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
974|11|17|"In 2016 Google's Android practices became the focus of a European Union antitrust investigation, and its complaints were a mirror image of Google's purposeful construction and protection of vital supply routes in Search and Mobile. Once again, governmental opposition to Google's monopolistic activities emphasized traditional competitive harms at the expense of surveillance capitalism's new harms. By April of 2013, Eric Schmidt told a conference devoted to ""all things"" digital that ""our goal with Android []is to reach everyone. We'll cross one billion Android devices in six to nine months. In a year or two, we'll hit two billion.... *A relatively inexpensive smartphone with a browser is all you need to get the world's information.*"" That final sentence presumably was intended to describe benefits to Android's users. However, it is an even-more-effective summary of Google's own ambitions and an insight into the vital economies of scale associated with this mobile supply route."|Chap 11, Para 17|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
975|11|18|"Google fiercely defends threatened supply routes. Any disruption of its extraction operations and its exclusive claims to raw material is the line that cannot be breached. In 2009 Android manufacturer Motorola chose to replace Google's free location services with those of Skyhook Wireless, which, Motorola believed, produced more-reliable results. A Google product manager admitted Skyhook's superiority but expressed his concerns in an e-mail to a Google executive, noting that if other manufacturers switched to Skyhook, it ""would be awful for Google, because it will cut off our ability to continue collecting data"" for the company's Wi-Fi location database. Court documents from Skyhook's eventual lawsuit against Motorola (and Samsung) include an e-mail from Google's senior vice president of Mobile to Motorola's CEO, insisting that the interruption of Google's data collection was a ""stop-ship issue."""|Chap 11, Para 18|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
976|11|19|"Another legal fracas further illustrates how products such as Android are valued more for supply than for sales. Disconnect, Inc., founded in 2011 by two former Google engineers and a privacy-rights attorney, developed desktop and mobile applications ""to protect the privacy and security of internet users by blocking invisible, unsolicited network connections between a user's browser or mobile device and sites/services that engage in invisible tracking or are known or suspected distributors of malware... not only when he browses the web, but also when he uses other third-party mobile applications."" Disconnect specifically took aim at the ""invisible, unsolicited and frequently undisclosed"" network connections from third-party sites and services that occur as soon as you visit a website or open a mobile application."|Chap 11, Para 19|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
977|11|20|"Unfortunately for Disconnect, the very process that it aimed to impede had been established as a significant supply route for Google and other surveillance capitalists. Several studies explain the extent of Google's extraction []architecture, including the Web Privacy Census, which primarily measured cookies. The census analyzed the top 100, 1,000, and 25,000 websites in 2011, 2012, and 2015, years of feverish discovery and elaboration for surveillance capitalists. The comparisons between 2012 and 2015 revealed more than twice as many sites with 100 or more cookies and more than three times the number of sites with 150 or more cookies. In 2015 the team found that anyone who simply visited the 100 most popular websites would collect over 6,000 cookies in his or her computer, 83 percent of which were from third parties unrelated to the website that was visited. The census found ""Google tracking infrastructure"" on 92 of the top 100 sites and 923 of the top 1,000 sites, concluding that ""Google's ability to track users on popular websites is unparalleled, and it approaches the level of surveillance that only an Internet Service Provider can achieve."""|Chap 11, Para 20|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
978|11|21|"Another 2015 analysis, this one of the top one million websites, by Timothy Libert of the University of Pennsylvania, found that 90 percent leak data to an average of nine external domains that track, capture, and expropriate user data for commercial purposes. Among these websites, 78 percent initiate third-party transfers to a domain owned by one company: Google. Another 34 percent transfer to a Facebook-owned domain. Steven Englehardt and Arvind Narayanan from Princeton University reported in 2016 on the results of their measurement and analysis of tracking data from one million websites. They identified 81,000 third parties, but only 123 of those are present on more than 1 percent of sites. Of that group, the top five third parties and twelve of the top twenty are Google-owned domains. ""In fact,"" they conclude, ""Google, Facebook, and Twitter are the only third-party entities present on more than 10% of sites."" Chinese researchers investigated 10,000 apps from the top third-party app markets in 2017. They found a ""covert"" process in which an app autonomously launches other apps in the background of your phone, and they concluded that this ""app collusion"" was most prevalent in third-party Android markets. Of the 1,000 top apps on one of China's popular platforms, 822 launched an average of 76 other apps, and of these launches, 77 percent were triggered by cloud-based ""push services"" that are intended to update apps but are obviously doing a lot more. In the Android environment, the researchers note, Google provides the push service."|Chap 11, Para 21|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
979|11|22|"[]Finally, extraordinary research from the French nonprofit Exodus Privacy and the Yale Privacy Lab in 2017 documented the exponential proliferation of tracking software. Exodus identified 44 trackers in more than 300 apps for Google's Android platform, some of which are also produced for Apple's operating system. Altogether, these apps have been downloaded billions of times. Two themes stand out in the research report: ubiquity and intensification. First, there is hardly an innocent app; if it's not tracking you now, it may be doing so in the next week or month: ""There is an entire industry based upon these trackers, and apps identified as 'clean' today may contain trackers that have not yet been identified. Tracker code may also be added by developers to new versions of apps in the future."" Second is that even the most innocent-seeming applications such as weather, flashlights, ride sharing, and dating apps are ""infested"" with dozens of tracking programs that rely on increasingly bizarre, aggressive, and illegible tactics to collect massive amounts of behavioral surplus ultimately directed at ad targeting. For example, the ad tracker FidZup developed ""communication between a sonic emitter and a mobile phone...."" It can detect the presence of mobile phones and therefore their owners by diffusing a tone, inaudible to the human ear, inside a building: ""Users installing 'Bottin Gourmand,' a guide to restaurants and hotels in France, would thus have their physical location tracked via retail outlet speakers as they move around Paris. Their experience would be shared by readers of a car magazine app 'Auto Journal' and the TV guide app 'TeleStar.'"" In a pattern foreshadowed by the Google patent that we examined in [Chapter 3](chapter003.xhtml) and that we shall see repeatedly in the coming chapters, the research findings emphasize that the always-on tracking is impervious to the Android ""permissions system,"" despite its promises of user control."|Chap 11, Para 22|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
980|11|23|"Given the hostility and intensity of these supply operations, it is not too surprising that Disconnect software was banned from Google Play's vast catalog of mobile apps, leading to Disconnect's lawsuit against Google in 2015. The startup's complaint explains that ""advertising companies including Google use these invisible connections to 'track' the user as he/she browses the web or opens other mobile applications, in order to collect personal information about the user, create a 'profile' of the user, and make money targeting advertising to the user."" It went on to argue that the privacy protections []offered by Google ""invariably permit the company to continue to gather private information...."" Google's ban of the Disconnect app is exceptionally revealing in light of the fact that, unlike Apple, Google is notoriously ""libertarian"" when it comes to the millions of apps sold or downloaded for ""free"" from its app store. Its loose guidelines attempt to identify and exclude malicious applications but little else."|Chap 11, Para 23|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
981|11|24|Disconnect's founders attempted to challenge the extraction imperative, but they could not do so alone. After trying---without success---to negotiate with Google, they eventually joined other organizations in filing a complaint against Google in the EU, helping to precipitate an Android-focused antitrust probe. As Disconnect argued,|Chap 11, Para 24|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
982|11|25|":::  Google is under enormous pressure from the financial community to increase the ""effectiveness"" of its tracking, so that it can increase revenues and profits. Giving a user the ability to control his own privacy information (and to protect himself from malware) by blocking invisible connections to problematic sites constitutes an existential threat to Google. :::"|Chap 11, Para 25|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
983|11|26|"As ex-Googlers, the founders of Disconnect thought that they knew their adversary well, but they underestimated the progress of surveillance capitalism's institutionalization and the ferocity with which the corporation was prepared to fend off ""existential threats"" to its supply routes."|Chap 11, Para 26|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
984|11|27|Long before Disconnect, Google had discovered that successful dispossession is not a single action but rather an intricate convergence of political, social, administrative, and technical operations that requires cunning management over a substantial period of time. Its dispossession operations reveal *a predictable sequence of stages* that must be crafted and orchestrated in great detail in order to achieve their ultimate destination as a system of facts through which surplus extraction is normalized.|Chap 11, Para 27|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
985|11|28|"[]The four stages of the cycle are *incursion, habituation, adaptation,* and *redirection.* Taken together, these stages constitute a ""theory of change"" that describes and predicts dispossession as a political and cultural operation supported by an elaborate range of administrative, technical, and material capabilities. There are many vivid examples of this cycle, including Google's Gmail; Google's efforts to establish supply routes in social networks, first with Buzz and then with Google+; and the company's development of Google Glass. In this chapter we focus on the Street View narrative for a close look at the dispossession cycle and its management challenges."|Chap 11, Para 28|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
986|11|29|"The first stage of successful dispossession is initiated by unilateral *incursion* into undefended space: your laptop, your phone, a web page, the street where you live, an e-mail to your friend, your walk in the park, browsing online for a birthday gift, sharing photos of your kids, your interests and tastes, your digestion, your tears, your attention, your feelings, your face. The incursion is when dispossession operations rely on their virtual capabilities to kidnap behavioral surplus from the nonmarket spaces of everyday life where it lives. The incursion initiates Google's most basic and prolific form of dispossession: Arendt's repeated ""original sin of simple robbery."" Incursion moves down the road without looking left or right, continuously laying claim to decision rights over whatever is in its path. ""I'm taking this,"" it says. ""These are mine now."""|Chap 11, Para 29|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
987|11|30|The company has learned to launch incursions and proceed until resistance is encountered. It then seduces, ignores, overwhelms, or simply exhausts its adversaries. Seduction means a cascade of golden enticements: unprecedented storage, access to new qualities of information, new conveniences. When necessary, the company can just as easily pivot toward harsher tactics that aim to deplete its adversaries' time, money, and grit. There are hundreds of cases launched against Google by countries, states, groups, and individuals, and there are many more cases that never become public. According to Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), no one knows precisely how many lawsuits there are around the world. The legal challenges are varied, but they nearly always come back to the same thing: unilateral incursion met by resistance.|Chap 11, Para 30|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
988|11|31|"Legal opposition and social protest have surfaced in relation to the digitalization of books, the collection of personal information through Street []View's Wi-Fi and camera capabilities, the capture of voice communications, the bypassing of privacy settings, the manipulation of search results, the extensive retention of search data, the tracking of smartphone location data, wearable technologies and facial-recognition capabilities, the secret collection of student data for commercial purposes, and the consolidation of user profiles across all Google's services and devices, just to name several instances. Expect to see drones, body sensors, neurotransmitters, ""digital assistants,"" and other sensored devices on this list in the years to come. Meanwhile, Google is consistently stunning in its sense of entitlement, resolve, and audacity. The extraction imperative compels it to push new boundaries into undefended space."|Chap 11, Para 31|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
989|11|32|In a second stage the aim is *habituation.* Whereas lawsuits and investigations unwind at the tedious pace of democratic institutions, Google continues the development of its contested practices at high velocity. During the elapsed time of FTC and FCC inquiries, court cases, judicial reviews, and EU Commission investigations, the new contested practices become more firmly established as institutional facts, rapidly bolstered by growing ecosystems of stakeholders. People habituate to the incursion with some combination of agreement, helplessness, and resignation. The sense of astonishment and outrage dissipates. The incursion itself, once unthinkable, slowly worms its way into the ordinary. Worse still, it gradually comes to seem inevitable. New dependencies develop. As populations grow numb, it becomes more difficult for individuals and groups to complain.|Chap 11, Para 32|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
990|11|33|In a third stage of the cycle, when Google is occasionally forced to alter its practices, its executives and engineers produce superficial but tactically effective *adaptations* that satisfy the immediate demands of government authorities, court rulings, and public opinion. Meanwhile, in a final stage the corporation regroups to cultivate new rhetoric, methods, and design elements that *redirect* contested supply operations just enough so that they appear to be compliant with social and legal demands. The creativity, financial resources, and determination brought to the task of managing this staged process are flexible and dynamic. In contrast, the operational necessity for economies of scale in the capture of behavioral surplus is a perpetual-motion machine whose implacable rhythms offer no room for divergence.|Chap 11, Para 33|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
991|11|34|[]The theory and practice of dispossession were developed and refined as the company learned how to counter and transform public resistance as an essential condition for the protection and expansion of its behavioral surplus franchise. Google's launch of Gmail on April Fool's Day, 2004, provided an early occasion to climb this learning curve as the corporation faced down public outrage over the automated scanning of e-mail content intended as a fresh source of surplus for targeted ads. Eventually, the dispossession cycle was refined as an explicit theory of change that framed a tactical game plan, which is by now regularly evoked as the surveillance capitalist corporation's battle-tested response to societal resistance.|Chap 11, Para 34|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
992|11|35|"The dispossession cycle at Google was so successful in facing down the threats to Gmail that it was replicated and further elaborated in the battles over Google Street View, the street-mapping operation launched in 2007. Once again, the company did not ask permission. It simply repeated the ""original sin of simple robbery"" and took what it wanted, waiting for resistance to run its course as it devoured and datafied the world's public spaces, streets, buildings, and homes."|Chap 11, Para 35|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
993|11|37|"Street View first entered public awareness with an apparently benign blog post. Peter Fleischer, Google's ""privacy counsel,"" helped launch the new ""service"" by writing a paean celebrating America's ""noble tradition"" of public spaces, where, he claimed, ""people don't have the same expectations of privacy as they do in their homes."" As a lawyer, Fleischer knows the work that words do in establishing contracts and setting precedents, so it pays to read his 2007 words with care. His casually declarative prose undertakes some extraordinary work as he asserts that all public spaces are fair game for Google's taking. In his account, any public space is a fitting subject for the firm's new breed of incursion without authorization, knowledge, or agreement. Homes, streets, neighborhoods, villages, towns, cities: they are no longer local scenes where neighbors live and walk, where residents meet and talk. Google Street View, we are informed, claims every place as just another object among objects in an infinite grid of GPS coordinates and camera angles."|Chap 11, Para 37|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
994|11|38|[]In his declaration, Fleischer intends to establish Google's prerogative to empty every place of the subjective meanings that unite the human beings who gather there. Yes, when we leave our home we know we will be seen, but we expect to be seen by one another in spaces that we choose. Instead, it's all impersonal spectacle now. My house, my street, my neighborhood, my favorite café: each is redefined as a living tourist brochure, surveillance target, and strip mine, an object for universal inspection and commercial expropriation.|Chap 11, Para 38|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
995|11|39|Google had already taken everything on the web, but Street View and Google's other mapping operations, Google Maps and Google Earth (the company's 3-D view of the world using satellite and aerial imagery), announced an even-more-ambitious vision. Everything in the world was to be known and rendered by Google, accessed through Google, and indexed by Google in its infinite appetite for behavioral surplus. The presumption is that nothing is beyond Google's borders. The world is vanquished now, on its knees, and brought to you by Google.|Chap 11, Para 39|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
996|11|40|"The blog post that accompanied Street View is a precise replica of the invaders who once landed on that blameless Caribbean beach. Those *adelantados* concealed the bare facts of invasion in elaborate gestures of friendship and humility that made it impossible to discern the clear and present danger implicit in their arrival. Fleischer similarly assures his audience of friendly terms. Street View, which used cartoonishly wrapped cars with a large 360-degree camera mount on the roof to capture the imagery it sought, was designed to ""respect the privacy of people who happen to be walking down a public street,"" Fleischer wrote. ""That's why we designed a simple process for anyone to contact us and have their image removed,"" and he promised that it would respect laws and customs ""in other parts of the world."""|Chap 11, Para 40|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
997|11|41|"Resistance came swiftly and often. By January 2009, Street View was facing opposition in Germany and Japan. John Hanke, by then the vice president for Google Maps--related products, dismissed the uproar. (You will recall that Hanke had founded the CIA-funded satellite mapping company, Keyhole, and after Google's purchase he led its transformation into Google Earth.) He told a reporter that it was all simply part of a ""cycle of people understanding exactly what it is and what it isn't and what they shouldn't really be concerned about""---in other words, the dispossession cycle. Google Earth was also under fire, blamed for aiding a deadly terrorist attack in Mumbai, []but Hanke insisted that the debate over Google Earth or Street View had ""mostly died off"" in ""the West."" He cleverly equated any resistance to Google's incursions with the anti-freedom-of-expression interests of authoritarian governments and their ""closed information societies."" This would become a standard rhetorical device for Google and its allies as they executed their offense."|Chap 11, Para 41|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
998|11|42|"Was Hanke surprised, then, when in April 2009 residents of the quiet English village of Broughton blocked a Street View car that tried to breach the village perimeter, calling it an unwelcome intrusion? This was ""the West,"" after all, but the debate over privacy, self-determination, and decision rights was anything but dead. Privacy International submitted a formal complaint to the UK privacy authority, citing more than 200 reports from people who were identifiable on Street View images and demanded that the service be suspended."|Chap 11, Para 42|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
999|11|43|"Google's executives had apparently missed Fleischer's memo on respecting privacy claims. Instead, Hanke dismissed the protesters out of hand. He told the *London Times* that the company was undeterred and planned to complete coverage of the UK by the end of that year. He declared that Street View's information was ""good for the economy and good for us as individuals.... It is about giving people powerful information so that they can make better choices."""|Chap 11, Para 43|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1000|11|44|Hanke's remarks were wishful thinking, of course, but they were consistent with Google's wider practice: it's great to empower people, but not *too* much, lest they notice the pilfering of their decision rights and try to reclaim them. The firm wants to enable people to make better choices, but not if those choices impede Google's own imperatives. Google's ideal society is a population of distant users, not a citizenry. It idealizes people who are informed, but only in the ways that the corporation chooses. It means for us to be docile, harmonious, and, above all, grateful.|Chap 11, Para 44|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1001|11|45|"In 2010 the German Federal Commission for Data Protection announced that Google's Street View operation actually camouflaged a covert data sweep; Street View cars were secretly collecting personal data from private Wi-Fi networks. Google denied the charge, insisting that it was gathering only publicly broadcast Wi-Fi network names and the identifying addresses of Wi-Fi routers, but not personal information sent over the network. []Within days, an independent analysis by German security experts proved decisively that Street View's cars were extracting unencrypted personal information from homes. Google was forced to concede that it had intercepted and stored ""payload data,"" personal information grabbed from unencrypted Wi-Fi transmissions. As its apologetic blog post noted, ""In some instances entire emails and URLs were captured, as well as passwords."" Technical experts in Canada, France, and the Netherlands discovered that the payload data included names, telephone numbers, credit information, passwords, messages, e-mails, and chat transcripts, as well as records of online dating, pornography, browsing behavior, medical information, location data, photos, and video and audio files.

In Germany, where the firm's actions were in clear violation of privacy and data-protection laws, officials reacted angrily and warned that Google would face EU investigations and consequences in the German courts. A bill was introduced into the German Parliament that proposed to fine Google for displaying personal property without owners' consent. Google faced fresh litigation in Switzerland, Canada, France, and the Netherlands. By 2012, there were multiple investigations in twelve countries, including most of Europe, the North Atlantic, and Australia, and Google had been found guilty of violating laws in at least nine countries."|Chap 11, Para 46|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1003|11|47|"In the US, attorneys general from thirty-eight states launched a probe into Google's Street View practices. Private citizens filed numerous class-action suits, eight of which were consolidated in the Northern California US District Court. The head of Privacy International said that Google was becoming ""Big Brother."" The Electronic Privacy Information Center championed substantial legal resistance in the US against Google's efforts to avoid repercussions in the wake of the Spy-Fi scandal, and it maintained a detailed and continuously updated online overview of the worldwide outrage, protests, investigations, litigation, and settlements in response to Google Street View and its extraction tactics."|Chap 11, Para 47|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1004|11|48|"Google characterized Street View's ""privacy violations"" as a ""mistake"" made by a single engineer working on an ""experimental"" project, whose code []had inadvertently made it into Street View's software. The firm refused to release the identity of the mystery engineer and insisted that the project's leaders were unaware of the data capture and ""had no intention"" of using those data. As Eric Schmidt told the *Financial Times,* ""We screwed up,"" noting that the engineer in question would face an internal investigation for his clear ""violation"" of Google's policies. Unbowed, Schmidt insisted on the validity of Google's mission to index all the world's information."|Chap 11, Para 48|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1005|11|49|"A 2012 investigation by the Federal Communications Commission described the case as ""a deliberate software-design decision by one of the Google employees working on the Street View project."" The engineer had been selected for the team because of his unique expertise in Wi-Fi ""wardriving,"" the practice of driving around using equipment to locate wireless networks. His design notes indicated that user traffic and location data would be logged along with ""information about what they are doing"" that would ""be analyzed offline for use in other initiatives."" The notes identified but then dismissed ""privacy considerations."""|Chap 11, Para 49|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1006|11|50|The FCC found evidence that contradicted Google's scapegoating narrative. The records showed that the engineer had e-mailed links to his software documentation to project leaders, who then shared them with the entire Street View team. It also found evidence that on at least two occasions, the engineer told his colleagues that Street View was collecting personal data. Despite these facts along with evidence of the company's exhaustive internal software reviews and testing procedures and the regular transfer of payload data from Street View's hard disks to Google's Oregon data center, Google's engineers denied any knowledge of personal data collection.|Chap 11, Para 50|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1007|11|52|"Hanke's bet that the ""cycle"" would eventually wear down resistance reflects a key operational component of the extraction imperative, discovered in Search, refined with Gmail, and elaborated with Street View.

1008|11|53|"The April 2012 FCC report is heart wrenching in its way, a melancholic depiction of democracy's vulnerability in the face-off with a wealthy, []determined, and audacious surveillance capitalist opponent. In November 2010 the FCC sent Google a letter of inquiry requesting necessary information. Little was forthcoming. By March of the next year, a second ""supplemental"" letter was sent. Google's response was incomplete information and lack of cooperation, which produced another ""demand letter"" in August. Google's continued lack of engagement required yet another letter in late October. The FCC staff was burdened with following up and chasing down evasive corporate executives and their representatives for an entire year."|Chap 11, Para 53|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1009|11|54|"The document is a revelation of negative space and a saga of democracy rebuffed. The FCC's detailed initial request produced ""only five documents"" and no e-mails. The corporation said that it had no time to undertake a comprehensive review, calling it ""burdensome."" Google ""failed"" to identify relevant individuals. It ""redacted"" names. It asserted that the information requested ""serves no useful purpose."" It ""failed"" to verify information. When asked for specific submissions, ""Google did not do so."" Google ""argued"" that it should ""not be required"" to provide access to the payload data it had illicitly collected. ""Google waited...."" The phrases ""failed to respond"" and ""failed to provide"" are repeated throughout the account. ""Google violated Commission orders... delaying...."" Affidavits were requested five times, but the company did not provide any of these until September 2011, after the FCC threatened a subpoena. The mystery engineer simply refused to speak with investigators, citing his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. As the report concludes, ""There is evidence that Google's failure to cooperate with the Bureau was in many or all cases deliberate."" It might have said ""imperative."""|Chap 11, Para 54|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1010|11|55|Ultimately, the corporation's lawyers prevailed, defending Google's data sweeps with a single obscure passage in a decades-old wiretap law. Perhaps the most telling element of the entire episode is that the same democratic system of laws and rules that the corporation openly treated with scorn was invoked to protect it from accountability. In the end the FCC fined Google only \$25,000 for obstructing its investigation. Google did not evade legal consequences because society agreed with its practices, but because there was not enough relevant law to protect citizens from its incursions.|Chap 11, Para 55|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1011|11|56|"The thirty-eight attorneys general did not fare much better. When the group's leader, Connecticut's Richard Blumenthal, issued a civil investigative []demand (equivalent to a subpoena) to get access to the infamous private data, ""Google ignored it."" The company finally agreed to settle with the states in 2013, accepting a mere \$7 million fine and a series of agreements regarding ""aggressive"" self-policing. The *New York Times* announced that Google had finally admitted that ""it had violated people's privacy during its Street View mapping project, when it casually scooped up... personal information,"" as if this scandal had been the only contested element in the whole affair. State officials crowed that ""the industry giant... is committing to change its corporate culture to encourage sensitivity to issues of personal data privacy."" In light of the fact that the extraction imperative is what makes this giant a giant, one doesn't know whether to laugh or cry at the confidence of the attorneys general in Google's commitment to privacy self-regulation."|Chap 11, Para 56|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1012|11|57|"There are two key elements here that illuminate habituation tactics. The first is the simple fact of the elapsed time between Street View's initial incursion in 2007, the 2010 scandal, the 2012 conclusion of the FCC inquiry, and the 2013 conclusion of the states' investigation. The German investigation also closed in late 2012, with little to show for its trouble. Other contests and lawsuits lumbered on. Despite all the sound and fury, Google continued to operate Street View during those years. Between 2008 and 2010, 600 billion bytes of personal information were collected ""illegitimately"" around the world, 200 billion of those in the US. The corporation said that it had discontinued personal data collection. Had it? Can anyone say with certainty? Even if it had, the original incursion that was Street View continued unscathed."|Chap 11, Para 57|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1013|11|58|The second point is that in retrospect, one sees that the very idea of a single rogue engineer was designed and elaborated as a brilliant piece of misdirection, a classic scapegoating ploy. It directed attention away from the ambitious and controversial agenda of the extraction imperative toward a different narrative of a single infected cell excised from the flesh of an enormous but innocent organism. All that was left was to excise the infected flesh and let the organism declare itself cured of its privacy kleptomania. Then---a return to the streets, born again.|Chap 11, Para 58|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1014|11|59|"Google achieved exactly what Hanke had predicted. Street View's fundamental audacity, the unprecedented astonishing incursion that drew English villagers into the streets to block a Google camera car, enjoyed six more years []of rooting in global consciousness. The corporation's strategic discipline when it comes to stonewalling, snubbing, and exploiting democracy brought six more years of people using Street View data and six more years to build the tacit case for Google's inevitability and our helplessness. There were six more years for this simple robbery of decision rights to shade into normalcy and even to be reckoned as ""convenient,"" ""useful,"" or ""marvelous."""|Chap 11, Para 59|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1015|11|61|"In October 2010, just before the corporation received the FCC's first letter of inquiry, Google's senior vice president of Engineering and Research announced ""stronger privacy controls"" in an official Google blog post. ""We've failed badly here,"" he said. The Street View scandal was framed as an inadvertent error, a single blemish on a company that works hard ""to earn your trust."" The post assured the public that the corporation was talking to external regulators ""about possible improvements to our policies"" and promised that it would make changes to ensure user privacy. Alma Whitten, a Google executive with credentials in computer security and privacy controls, was appointed as director of Privacy across engineering and product management. The blog also introduced a new internal training emphasis on ""responsible collection, use and handling of user data."" Finally, the post pledged new internal controls to oversee how data are handled. ""We are mortified by what happened,"" it read, ""but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users."""|Chap 11, Para 61|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1016|11|62|Though pledging reform to the public, the corporation was simultaneously forced to adapt to governmental demands in a range of countries---including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Holland, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Spain, South Korea, the UK, and the US---where Street View was subjected to litigation, fines, and/or regulation. In Japan, homeowners complained of Street View cameras that peered above privacy fencing to record private homes. Google agreed to government demands to lower its cameras, reshoot all images, and blur identifiable facial images and license plates. In Germany, Google allowed residents to request []that their homes be blurred in any Street View images. Nearly 250,000 households made opt-out requests in 2009--2010, requiring Google to hire 200 temporary programmers to meet the demand. Google was fined 145,000 euros by the Hamburg data-protection supervisor who had first discovered the Street View illicit data gathering, just short of the 150,000 euro fee he could have imposed. It was the largest fine ever to have been levied by European regulators for privacy concerns. The discount reflected Google's assurances that it would swiftly and thoroughly delete the payload data. In 2011 Google ended its Street View program in Germany, continuing to support but no longer update the images it had already collected.|Chap 11, Para 62|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1017|11|63|Other countries imposed bans on Street View operations. Switzerland initially banned the service in 2009, insisting that Google remove all imagery it had posted of Swiss towns and cities. Eventually, the ban was lifted, but the Swiss Federal Administrative Court imposed a series of strict guidelines, including blurring faces, instituting opt-out measures, and reducing camera heights. By 2016, Google's service remained confined to outdoor tourist sites. The corporation also faced Street View bans in Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, India, and Lithuania. By the summer of 2017, though, Street View data were available from at least some regions of each of these countries.|Chap 11, Para 63|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1018|11|65|"What Google did not say in its mea culpa blog post, the one thing that it could not say, was that it would abandon its fundamental logic of accumulation: the principles of surveillance capitalism that had brought the behemoth into existence and sustained its growth. The message of Street View's redirection campaign was that Google would not exempt anything from the grid. Everything must be corralled for conversion into raw material. Short of institutional suicide, there is little that Google *can* say or do to ensure ""user privacy."" This helps to explain why, as one 2015 article celebrating the history of Google Maps observes, ""Google Maps was attracting all sorts of privacy controversies... people were freaked out.... But that doesn't mean Street View has been tamped down as a project. It's now available in 65 of Google Maps' 200-some countries."""|Chap 11, Para 65|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1019|11|66|[]Alma Whitten's job was to repair Google's privacy reputation, not to dismantle the extraction imperative and its relentless demand for economies of scale in the supply function. This is to say that her job was a logical impossibility. That she may have nevertheless taken it seriously is suggested by the fact that just two-and-a-half years after her appointment as privacy czar, she announced her retirement from Google in April 2013. Indeed, it is painful to watch Whitten testify about Google's practices to an early-2013 congressional hearing. She was under questioning from Congress, and one sees the effort required as she hunts for the words to convey an answer without conveying the truth. The time had come to regroup and redirect the global mapping project, not to end it.|Chap 11, Para 66|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1020|11|67|"That nothing much had changed or would change was immediately suggested by the fate of Google's mystery engineer in the two years that followed the scandal. Within days of the FCC report in April 2012, a former state investigator who had been assigned to the Street View inquiry identified Google's ""rogue"" actor as Marius Milner, a celebrated hacker and wardriving specialist. It had been two years since the supposedly irreparable damage that he inflicted on Google and his ""clear violation"" of policy, yet he continued to be employed at the firm in its YouTube operations. Later that year, he would be one of six inventors on a team led by John Hanke to patent ""A System and Method for Transporting Virtual Objects in a Parallel Reality Game."""|Chap 11, Para 67|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1021|11|68|"The invention in which Milner participated was related to a virtual reality game called Ingress, also developed by Hanke and his team at Google. (Hanke would eventually establish his own shop, Niantic Labs, within Google's new Alphabet holding company.) Ingress became a test bed for many of the foundational concepts that reappeared in another ""game,"" Pokémon Go, a prototype of a second phase of surveillance capitalist expansion that we examine closely in Part II. In this next phase, Google's maps are a critical resource for the expansion of digital dispossession from the virtual world to the one that we call ""real."" In light of those plans, Street View could not be allowed to die or even to be constrained. The corporation's senior product manager for Google Maps framed it succinctly in September 2012, just four months after the FCC investigation: ""If you look at the offline world, the real world in which we live, that information is not entirely online. Increasingly as []we go about our lives, we are trying to bridge that gap between what we see in the real world and \[the online world\], and Maps really plays that part."""|Chap 11, Para 68|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1022|11|69|"Google's closely guarded ""Ground Truth"" project, initiated in 2008 but only publicly revealed just four months after the FCC report in 2012, exemplifies the point. Ground Truth is the ""deep map"" that contains the detailed ""logic of places"": walking paths, goldfish ponds, highway on-ramps, traffic conditions, ferry lines, parks, campuses, neighborhoods, buildings, and more. Getting these details right is a source of competitive advantage in the contest for behavioral surplus accrued from mobile devices. The construction of the deep map draws on public resources such as geographic databases from the US Census Bureau and the US Geological Survey, but what distinguishes Google's maps from all others is the integration of its exclusive proprietary data from Street View. In other words, data compiled through public investments are augmented with data taken from a unilateral transfer of surplus behavior and decision rights. The composite results are then reclassified as private assets."|Chap 11, Para 69|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1023|11|70|"One of the first journalists invited to see demonstrations of Ground Truth in 2012, Alexis Madrigal, observed that ""the Maps team, largely driven by Street View, is publishing more imagery data every two weeks than Google possessed in total in 2006.... Google is up to five million miles driven now."" Street View cars are likened to Google Search's early web crawlers, which quietly commandeered web pages for indexing and access in the corporation's original act of dispossession. By 2012, Street View data also provided street signs and addresses. Soon, Madrigal wrote, ""any word that is visible from a road will become a part of Google's index of the physical world"" thanks to Street View. Madrigal's look at the Ground Truth operation concludes, ""The geographic data Google has assembled is not likely to be matched by any other company.... *They've built this whole playground as an elaborate lure for you.*"""|Chap 11, Para 70|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1024|11|71|"As one project leader put it, ""The challenge of deciding you're going to map the world is that you can't ever stop."" So it was that by 2016, Google's Street View website celebrated its successful evolution by stating, ""We've come a long way since our initial U.S. launch in 2007; today we've expanded our 360-degree panoramic views to include locations on all seven continents."" Street View's fleet of surveillance-gathering tools had been []augmented to include a wearable backpack, a three-wheeled pedicab, a snowmobile, and a trolley, all of which were designed to capture places that Street View cars could not traverse. Tourist boards and nonprofits were offered the use of the company's Trekker equipment (the backpack camera) to ""collect views of remote and unique places"" that were, literally and figuratively, ""off the grid."""|Chap 11, Para 71|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1025|11|72|What Google couldn't build, it bought. In 2013 the corporation won a reported bidding war with Facebook for Israeli social mapping startup Waze, a firm that pioneered community-sourced real-time traffic information. In 2014 it acquired real-time satellite imaging startup Skybox just as the US Department of Commerce lifted restrictions on high-resolution satellite imagery. As an expert explained,|Chap 11, Para 72|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1026|11|73|":::  If you imagine a satellite above your office then the old resolution could probably make out your desk. The new imagery---where each pixel measures around 31 cm---can now make out what's on your desk. When you reach this sort of frequency you can begin to add in what we call ""pattern of life"" analysis. This means looking at activity in terms of movement---not just identification. :::"|Chap 11, Para 73|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1027|11|74|"In this context one appreciates the significance of another aspect of Google's redirection campaign: a 2011 announcement that the corporation had breached ""a new frontier"" with the introduction of an ""indoor positioning system"" that enabled it to locate and follow people ""when you're inside an airport, shopping mall, or retail store."" Eventually, these new capabilities would include sensors and embedded cameras that let users map and navigate interior spaces. In a September 2014 blog, Google Maps' dynamic new capabilities were showcased to the public as your new ""co-pilot for deciding everything from turn-by-turn directions, to discovering new restaurants, to deciding which hiking trails to climb."" The post credits Street View with providing these wondrous new capabilities and announces the expansion of the whole incursion with the introduction of a mobile mapping tool dubbed ""Cartographer,"" worn as a backpack and able to map the interior of buildings. Cartographer's information could be added to the growing []navigational database of interior spaces, amplifying Google's ability to locate people and devices as they moved between outdoor and indoor spaces."|Chap 11, Para 74|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1028|11|75|"Building interiors had eluded Street View and the extraction imperative; few homeowners were likely to invite those cameras indoors. Instead, Cartographer's capabilities were bundled into the larger Street View redirection campaign and pitched to businesses as a way to enhance consumer trust, allay anxiety, and substantially increase revenues. Google exhorted consumer-facing businesses to ""invite customers inside."" With its ""Business View,"" consumers would be able to see inside thousands of hotels, restaurants, and other destinations. Search listings would feature the new Street View content. Hotel listings would offer a virtual tour of the properties. ""Give them the confidence they're seeking,"" Google told its business marketplace, by allowing consumers ""to experience your location before they arrive."" Google asserted that virtual tours ""double bookings,"" and it instated a certification program that enabled businesses to hire a Google-approved freelance photographer to produce images for Street View. These extraordinary new redirection tactics aimed to flip the old pattern. They reframed Street View from an edgy incursion circumventing resistance through stealth to an opulent VIP tent where businesses scrambled for an entry pass."|Chap 11, Para 75|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1029|11|76|"Street View's redirection and elaboration announced a critical shift in the orientation and ambition of the surveillance program: *it would no longer be only about routes, but about routing.* We will examine this new episode of dispossession in the chapters that follow. For now, suffice to say that Street View and the larger project of Google Maps illustrate the new and even more ambitious goals toward which this cycle of dispossession would soon point: the migration from an online data source to a real-world monitor to an advisor to an active shepherd---from knowledge to influence to control. Ultimately, Street View's elaborate data would become the basis for another complex of spectacular Google incursions: the self-driving car and ""Google City,"" which we learn more about in [Chapter 7](chapter012.xhtml). Those programs aim to take surplus capture to new levels while opening up substantial new frontiers for the establishment of behavioral futures markets in the real world of goods and services. It is important to understand that each level of innovation builds on the one before and that all are united in one aim, the extraction of behavioral surplus at scale."|Chap 11, Para 76|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1030|11|77|"[]In this progression, Google perceives an opportunity that it hopes its customers will come to appreciate: its ability to influence actual behavior as it occurs in the real spaces of everyday life. In 2016, for example, the corporation introduced a new Maps app feature called ""Driving Mode"" that suggests destinations and travel times without users even selecting where they want to go. If you searched for a hammer online, then ""Driving Mode"" can send you to a hardware store when you buckle up your seat belt. ""Google is integrating this 'push' technology into its main mobile search app,"" reported the *Wall Street Journal.*"|Chap 11, Para 77|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1031|11|78|"With this app, Google the ""copilot"" prompts an individual to turn left and right on a path defined by its continuously accruing knowledge of the person *and* the context. Predictions about where and why a person might spend money are derived from Google's exclusive access to behavior surplus and its equally exclusive analytic capabilities: *""Eat here."" ""Buy this.""* Google's surplus analysis can predict that you are likely to buy an expensive woolen suit, and its real-time location data can trigger the proprietor or advertiser's real-time prompt, matched to your profile and delivered at the very moment that you are within sight of the flannels, tweeds, and cashmeres. Push and pull, suggest, nudge, cajole, shame, seduce: Google wants to be your copilot for life itself. Each human response to each commercial prompt yields more data to refine into better prediction products. The prompts themselves are bought and paid for in a novel iteration of Google's online ad markets: *real-time, real-world trading in behavioral futures.* Your future."|Chap 11, Para 78|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1032|11|79|"The stakes are high in this market frontier, where *unpredictable behavior is the equivalent of lost revenue.* Google cannot leave anything to chance. In September 2016 the tech newsletter the *Register* revealed that the Google Play app preinstalled in the latest Android phone continuously checks a user's location, sending that information to your third-party apps as well as to Google's own servers. One security researcher was shocked when his Android phone prompted him to download the McDonald's app at the very moment that he crossed the threshold of the fast-food restaurant. He later discovered that Google Play had monitored his location thousands of times. Similarly, Google Maps ""doesn't give you a decent option of turning it off."" If you do, the operating system warns, ""basic features of your device may no longer function as intended."" Google's insistence reflects the authoritarian politics []of the extraction imperative as well as the corporation's own enslavement to the implacable demands of its economics."|Chap 11, Para 79|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1033|11|80|The historic point for us to consider here is that the once-spurned Street View found new life in its contribution to the decisive expansion of behavioral futures markets both online and in the real world. Once dedicated to targeted online advertising, these markets now grow to encompass predictions about what human beings will do now, soon, and later, whether they make their way online, on sidewalks and roads, or through rooms, halls, shops, lobbies, and corridors. These ambitious goals foreshadow fresh incursions and dispossessions as resistance is neutralized and populations fall into dulled submission.|Chap 11, Para 80|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1034|11|81|"Google discovered by chance or intention the source of every mapmaker's power. The great historian of cartography, John B. Harley, said it succinctly: ""Maps created empire."" They are essential for the effective ""pacification, civilization, and exploitation"" of territories imagined or claimed but not yet seized in practice. Places and people must be known in order to be controlled. ""The very lines on the map,"" wrote Harley, were a language of conquest in which ""the invaders parcel the continent among themselves in designs reflective of their own complex rivalries and relative power."" The first US rectangular land survey captured this language perfectly in its slogan: ""Order upon the Land."" The cartographer is the instrument of power as the author of that order, reducing reality to only two conditions: the map and oblivion. The cartographer's truth crystallizes the message that Google and all surveillance capitalists must impress upon all humans: *if you are not on our map, you do not exist.*"|Chap 11, Para 81|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1035|11|82|Projects such as Street View taught Google that it could assume the role of arbiter of the future and get away with it. It learned to sustain even the most-contested dispossession efforts when they are necessary to secure vital new supply lines. For example, while Street View protests erupted around the world and just months before Germany's announcement that Street View was secretly capturing personal information from unprotected Wi-Fi []networks, Google introduced Buzz---a platform intended to float Google's nets in the path of the coveted behavioral surplus that streamed from social networks. The invasive practices introduced with Buzz---it commandeered users' private information to establish their social networks by fiat---set off a fresh round of the dispossession cycle and its dramatic contests.|Chap 11, Para 82|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1036|11|83|As Google learned to successfully redirect supply routes, evading and nullifying opposition, it became even more emboldened to let slip the dogs of audacity and direct them toward havoc. Among many examples, Google Glass neatly illustrates the tenacity of the extraction imperative and its translation into commercial practice. Google Glass combined computation, communication, photography, GPS tracking, data retrieval, and audio and video recording capabilities in a wearable format patterned on eyeglasses. The data it gathered---location, audio, video, photos, and other personal information---moved from the device to Google's servers, merging with other supply routes to join the titanic one-way flow of behavioral surplus.|Chap 11, Para 83|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1037|11|84|"The project was seen as a precursor to more flexible and less overt forms of wearable computation and surplus capture. John Hanke described its familiar shape in the form of eyewear as suitable for ""the early adoption phases"" of wearable technology in much the same way that the first automobiles resembled horse-drawn buggies. In other words, the ""glasses"" were intended to disguise what was in fact unprecedented: ""Ultimately we will want these technologies, wherever they are on your body, to be totally optimized based on the job they're doing, not on what is more socially acceptable at that first moment of creation, just because it reminds people of something they've seen in the past."" Introduced with great flair in the spring of 2012 as fashion-forward futurism, it wasn't long before the public registered fresh horror at this bizarre invasion. Those who wore the device were recast as ""glassholes,"" and some businesses banned the glasses from their premises."|Chap 11, Para 84|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1038|11|85|"Privacy advocates protested the ""always on"" but ""undetectable"" recording of people and places that eliminates a person's reasonable expectation of privacy and/or anonymity. They warned of new risks as facial-recognition software is applied to these new data streams and predicted that technologies like Glass would fundamentally alter how people behave in public. By May 2013, a congressional privacy caucus asked CEO Larry Page for assurances on privacy safeguards for Glass, even as a Google conference was held to coach []developers on creating apps for the new device. In April 2014 Pew Research announced that 53 percent of Americans thought that smart wearables were ""a change for the worse,"" including 59 percent of American women."|Chap 11, Para 85|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1039|11|86|"Google continued to tough it out, waiting for habituation to kick in. That June it announced that Glass would offer the Livestream video-sharing app, enabling Glass users to stream everything around them to the internet in real time. When asked about these controversial and intrusive capabilities in the hands of any owner of the device, Livestream's CEO reckoned, ""Google is ultimately in charge of... setting the rules."" Sergey Brin made it clear that any resistance would be categorically rejected when he told the *Wall Street Journal,* ""People always have a natural aversion to innovation."""|Chap 11, Para 86|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1040|11|87|"Adaptation began in 2015 with the announcement that Glass would no longer be available. The company said nothing to acknowledge the public's revulsion or the social issues that Glass had raised. A short blog post announced, ""Now we're ready to put on our big kid shoes and learn how to run... you'll start to see future versions of Glass when they're ready."" An eyewear designer was tasked with transforming the look from a futuristic device to something more beautiful."|Chap 11, Para 87|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1041|11|88|"Redirection began quietly. In June 2015 the FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology received new design plans for Glass, and September brought fresh headlines announcing that Glass ""is getting a new name, and a new lease on life."" A year later, Eric Schmidt, now Google's chairman, put the situation into perspective: ""It is a big and very fundamental platform for Google."" He explained that Glass was withdrawn from public scrutiny only to ""make it ready for users... these things take time."" As more information trickled out of the corporation, it became clear that there was no intention of ceding potential new supply routes in wearable technologies, no matter the public reaction. Glass was the harbinger of a new ""wearables"" platform that would help support the migration of behavioral surplus operations from the online to the offline world."|Chap 11, Para 88|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER

This time there would be no frontal attack on public space. Instead, it was to be a tactical retreat to the workplace---the gold standard of habituation contexts, where invasive technologies are normalized among []captive populations of employees. ""Workers in many fields, like manufacturing, logistics, field services, and healthcare find it useful to consult a wearable device for information and other resources while their hands are busy,"" wrote the project's leader, and most press accounts lauded the move, citing productivity and efficiency increases in factories that deployed the new Glass. There was little acknowledgment that habituation to Glass at work was most certainly a back door to Glass in our streets or that the intrusive surveillance properties of the device would, with equal certainty, be imposed on the women and men required to use them as a condition of their employment."|Chap 11, Para 89|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1043|11|90|The lesson of Glass is that when one route to a supply source encounters obstacles, others are constructed to take up the slack and drive expansion. The corporation has begrudgingly learned to pay more attention to the public relations of these developments, but the unconditional demands of the extraction imperative mean that the dispossession cycle must proceed at full throttle, continuously claiming new territory.|Chap 11, Para 90|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1044|11|91|"Dispossession may be an act of ""simple robbery"" in theory, but in fact it is a complex, highly orchestrated political and material process that exhibits discernible stages and predictable dynamics. The theory of change exhibited here systematically transfers knowledge and rights from the many to the few in a glorious fog of Page's ""automagic."" It catalogues public contest as the unfortunate but predictable outcry of foolish populations who exhibit a knee-jerk ""resistance to change,"" wistfully clinging to an irretrievable past while denying an inevitable future: Google's future, surveillance capitalism's future. The theory indicates that opposition must simply be weathered as the signature of the first difficult phases of incursion. It assumes that opposition is fleeting, like the sharp yelp of pain when a Novocain needle first pierces the flesh, before numbness sets in."|Chap 11, Para 91|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1045|11|92|"Google's spectacular success in constructing the mechanisms and principles of surveillance capitalism and attracting surveillance revenues ignited competition in an escalating war of extraction. Google began in a blank space, []but it would soon contend with other firms drawn to surveillance revenues. Facebook was the first and has remained the most aggressive competitor for behavioral surplus supplies, initiating a wave of *incursions* at high speed, establishing a presence on the free and lawless surplus frontier while denying its actions, repelling criticism, and thoroughly confusing the public. The ""Like"" button, introduced widely in April 2010 as a communications tool among friends, presented an early opportunity for Facebook's Zuckerberg to master the dispossession cycle. By November of that year, a study of the *incursion* already underway was published by Dutch doctoral candidate and privacy researcher Arnold Roosendaal, who demonstrated that the button was a powerful supply mechanism from which behavioral surplus is continuously captured and transmitted, installing cookies in users' computers whether or not they click the button. Presciently describing the operation as an ""alternative business model,"" Roosendaal discovered that the button also tracks non-Facebook members and concluded that Facebook was potentially able to connect with, and therefore surveil, ""all web users."" Only two months earlier, Zuckerberg had characterized Facebook's growing catalogue of privacy violations as ""missteps."" Now he stuck to the script, eventually calling Roosendaal's discovery a ""bug."""|Chap 11, Para 92|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1046|11|93|"By 2011 the *habituation* stage of the cycle was in full swing. A May *Wall Street Journal* report confirmed Facebook's tracking, even when users don't click the button, and noted that the button was already installed on one-third of the world's one thousand most-visited websites. Meanwhile, Facebook's Chief Technology Officer said of the button, ""We don't use them for tracking and they're not intended for tracking."" On September 25, Australian hacker Nik Cubrilovic published findings showing that Facebook continued to track users even after they logged out of the site. Facebook announced that it would fix ""the glitch,"" explaining that certain cookies were tracking users in error, and noting that it could not cease the practice entirely due to ""safety"" and ""performance"" considerations. Journalists discovered that just three days before Cubrilovic's revelations, the corporation received a patent on specialized techniques for tracking users across web domains. The new data methods enabled Facebook to track users, create personal profiles on individuals and their social networks, receive reports from third parties on each []action of a Facebook user, and log those actions in the Facebook system in order to correlate them with specific ads served to specific individuals. The company immediately denied the relevance and importance of the patent."|Chap 11, Para 93|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1047|11|94|"With Facebook's unflinching assertions that it did not track users, even in the face of many robust facts, specialists grew more frustrated and the public more confused. This appears to have been the point. By denying every accusation and pledging its commitment to user well-being, Facebook secured a solid year and a half with which to habituate the world to its ""Like"" button, institutionalizing that iconic thumb turned toward the sky as an indispensable prosthetic of virtual communication."|Chap 11, Para 94|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1048|11|95|"This solid achievement paved the way for the *adaptation* stage of the dispossession cycle, when in late November 2011, Facebook consented to a settlement with the FTC over charges that it had systematically ""deceived consumers by telling them that they could keep their Facebook information private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public."" The complaint brought by EPIC and a coalition of privacy advocates in 2009 initiated an FTC investigation that yielded plenty of evidence of the corporation's broken promises. These included website changes that made private information public, third-party access to users' personal data, leakage of personal data to third-party apps, a ""verified apps"" program in which nothing was verified, enabling advertisers to access personal information, allowing access to personal data after accounts were deleted, and violations of the Safe Harbor Framework, which governs data transfers between the United States and the EU. In the parallel universe of surveillance capitalism, each one of these violations was worthy of a five-star rating from the extraction imperative. The FTC order barred the company from making further privacy misrepresentations, required users' affirmative consent to new privacy policies, and mandated a comprehensive privacy program to be audited every two years for twenty years. FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz insisted that ""Facebook's innovation does not have to come at the expense of consumer privacy."" But Leibowitz was not up against a company; he was up against a new market form with distinct and intractable imperatives whose mandates can be fulfilled *only* at the expense of user privacy."|Chap 11, Para 95|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1049|11|96|"*Redirection* came swiftly. In 2012 the company announced it would target ads based on mobile app use, as it worked with Datalogix to determine when []online ads result in a real-world purchase. This gambit required mining personal information, including e-mail addresses, from user accounts. In 2012 Facebook also gave advertisers access to targeting data that included users' e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and website visits, and it admitted that its system scans personal messages for links to third-party websites and automatically registers a ""like"" on the linked web page. By 2014, the corporation announced that it would be tracking users across the internet using, among its other digital widgets, the ""Like"" button, in order to build detailed profiles for personalized ad pitches. Its ""comprehensive privacy program"" advised users of this new tracking policy, reversing every assertion since April 2010 with a few lines inserted into a dense and lengthy terms-of-service agreement. No opt-out privacy option was offered. The truth was finally out: the bug was a feature."|Chap 11, Para 96|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1050|11|97|"Meanwhile, Google maintained the pledge that had been critical to the FTC's approval of its 2001 acquisition of the ad-tracking behemoth DoubleClick when it agreed not to combine data from the tracking network with other personally identifiable information in the absence of a user's opt-in consent. In this case, Google appears to have waited for Facebook to extend the surveillance capitalist frontier and bear the brunt of incursion and habituation. Later, in the summer of 2016, Google crossed that frontier with an announcement that a user's DoubleClick browsing history ""may be"" combined with personally identifiable information from Gmail and other Google services. Its promised opt-in function for this new level of tracking was presented with the headline ""Some new features for your Google account."" One privacy scholar characterized the move as the final blow to the last ""tiny semblance"" of privacy on the web. A coalition of privacy groups presented a new complaint to the FTC, implicitly recognizing the logic of the dispossession cycle: ""Google has done incrementally and furtively what would plainly be illegal if done all at once."""|Chap 11, Para 97|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1051|11|98|Facebook's IPO in 2012 was notoriously botched when last-minute downward revisions of its sales projections, precipitated by the rapid shift to mobile devices, led to some unsavory dealings among its investment bankers and their clients. But Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and their team quickly mastered the nuances of the dispossession cycle, this time to steer the company toward mobile ads. They learned to be skilled and ruthless hunters of []behavioral surplus, capturing supplies at scale, evading and resisting law, and upgrading the means of production to improve prediction products.|Chap 11, Para 98|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1052|11|99|"Surveillance revenues flowed fast and furiously, and the market lavishly rewarded the corporation's shareholders. By 2017, the *Financial Times* hailed the company's 71 percent earnings surge with the headline ""Facebook: The Mark of Greatness"" as Facebook's market capitalization rose to just under \$500 billion, with 2 billion average monthly active users. Facebook ranked seventh in one important tally of the top 100 companies in the first quarter of 2017, when just a year earlier it hadn't figured anywhere in the top 100. Advertising, primarily mobile, accounted for nearly every dollar of the company's revenue in the second quarter of 2017: \$9.2 billion of a total \$9.3 billion and a 47 percent increase over the prior year."|Chap 11, Para 99|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1053|11|100|The *Guardian* reported that Google and Facebook accounted for one-fifth of global ad spending in 2016, nearly double the figure of 2012, and by one accounting Google and Facebook owned almost 90 percent of the growth in advertising expenditures in 2016. Surveillance capitalism had propelled these corporations to a seemingly impregnable position.|Chap 11, Para 100|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1054|11|101|"Among the remaining three of the largest internet companies, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, it was Microsoft that first and most decisively turned toward surveillance capitalism as the means to restore its the role of CEO in February 2014. Microsoft had notoriously missed several key opportunities to compete with Google in the search business and develop its targeted advertising capabilities. As early as 2009, when Nadella was a senior vice president and manager of Microsoft's search business, he publicly criticized the company's failure to recognize the financial opportunities associated with that early phase of surveillance capitalism. ""In retrospect,"" he lamented, ""it was a terrible decision"" to end the search-ad service: ""None of us saw the paid-search model in all its glory."" Nadella recognized then that Microsoft's Bing search engine could not compete with Google because it lacked scale in behavioral surplus capture, the critical factor in the fabrication of high-quality prediction products: ""When you look at search... it's a game of scale. Clearly we don't have sufficient scale today and that hinders... the quality of the ad relevance which is perhaps the bigger issue we have today."""|Chap 11, Para 101|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1055|11|102|"[]Less than three months after assuming his new role, Nadella announced his intention to redirect the Microsoft ship straight into this game of scale with the April release of a study that the company had commissioned from market intelligence firm IDC. It concluded that ""companies taking advantage of their data have the potential to raise an additional \$1.6 trillion in revenue over companies that don't,"" and Nadella was determined to make landfall on the far shores of this rich new space. Microsoft would reap the advantages of its own data, and it would specialize in ""empowering"" its clients to do the same. Nadella composed a blog to signal the new direction, writing, ""The opportunity we have in this new world is to find a way of catalyzing this data exhaust from ubiquitous computing and converting it into fuel for ambient intelligence."" As a video outlining the new ""data vision"" explains, ""Data that was once untapped is now an asset."""|Chap 11, Para 102|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1056|11|103|"Many of Nadella's initiatives aim to make up for lost time in establishing robust supply routes to surplus behavior and upgrading the company's means of production. Bing's search engineering team built its own model of the digital and physical world with a technology it calls Satori: a self-learning system that is adding 28,000 DVDs of content every day. According to the project's senior director, ""It's mind-blowing how much data we have captured over the last couple of years. The line would extend to Venus and you would still have 7 trillion pixels left over."" All those pixels were being put to good use. In its October 2015 earnings call, the company announced that Bing had become profitable for the first time, thanks to around \$1 billion in search ad revenue from the previous quarter."|Chap 11, Para 103|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1057|11|104|"Another strategy to enhance Bing's access to behavioral surplus was the corporation's ""digital assistant,"" Cortana, to which users addressed more than one billion questions in the three months after its 2015 launch. As one Microsoft executive explains, ""Four out of five queries go to Google in the browser. In the \[Windows 10\] task bar \[where Cortana is accessed,\] five out of five queries go to Bing.... We're all in on search. Search is a key component to our monetization strategy."""|Chap 11, Para 104|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1058|11|105|"Cortana generates more than search traffic. As Microsoft's privacy policy explains, ""Cortana works best when you sign in and let her use data from your device, your personal Microsoft account, other Microsoft services, and []third-party services you choose to connect."" Like Page's automagic, Cortana is intended to inspire awestruck and grateful surrender. One Microsoft executive characterizes Cortana's message: ""'I know so much about you. I can help you in ways you don't quite expect. I can see patterns that you can't see.' That's the magic."""|Chap 11, Para 105|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1059|11|106|"Nevertheless, the company made a canny decision not to disclose the true extent of Cortana's knowledge to its users. It wants to know everything about you, but it does not want you to know how much it knows or that its operations are entirely geared to continuously learning more. Instead, the ""bot"" is programmed to ask for permission and confirmation. The idea is to avoid spooking the public by presenting Cortana's intelligence as ""progressive"" rather than ""autonomous,"" according to the project's group program manager, who noted that people do not want to be surprised by how much their phones are starting to take over: ""We made an explicit decision to be a little less 'magical' and little more transparent."""|Chap 11, Para 106|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1060|11|107|"Nadella envisions a new platform of ""conversations"" in which users interact with bots that induce them to eagerly disclose the details of their daily lives.

1062|11|109|"The release of Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 10, in July 2015 drove home the seriousness of purpose and urgency that the corporation now assigned to establishing and securing supply routes to behavioral surplus. One software engineer writing in *Slate* described it as ""a privacy morass in dire need of reform"" as he detailed how the system ""gives itself the []right to pass loads of your data to Microsoft's servers, use your bandwidth for Microsoft's own purposes, and profile your Windows usage."""|Chap 11, Para 109|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1063|11|110|"As many analysts quickly discovered, the system pushed users toward the ""express install"" function, in which every default setting enabled the maximum flow of personal information to the corporation's servers. An investigation by tech website *Ars Technica* revealed that even when those default settings were reversed and key services such as Cortana disabled, the system continued to access the internet and transmit information to Microsoft. In some instances those transmissions appeared to contain personal information, including a machine ID, user content, and location data."|Chap 11, Para 110|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1064|11|111|"According to an analysis by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), even users who opted out of Cortana were subject to an ""unprecedented"" amount of information capture, including text, voice, and touch input; web tracking; and telemetry data on their general use, programs, session duration, and more.

1065|11|112|"In 2016 Microsoft acquired LinkedIn, the professional social network, for \$26.2 billion.

These powerful new flows of social surplus from 450 million users can substantially enhance Microsoft prediction products, a key fact noted by Nadella in his announcement of the acquisition to investors: ""This can drive targeting and relevance to the next level."" Of the three key opportunities that Nadella cited to investors upon the announcement of the acquisition, one was ""Accelerate monetization through individual and organization subscriptions and targeted advertising."" Among the key factors here would be unified professional profiles across all services, devices, and channels and Microsoft's comprehensive knowledge of each individual user: ""Today Cortana knows about you, your organization and about the world.

1066|11|113|Once again, the market richly rewarded Microsoft, and Nadella, for the pivot toward surveillance revenues. When Nadella climbed into the CEO's []chair in February 2014, the company's shares were trading at around \$34, and its market value was roughly \$315 billion. Three years later, in January 2017, the corporation's market capitalization topped \$500 billion for the first time since 2000, and its shares rose to an all-time high of \$65.64.|Chap 11, Para 113|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1067|11|114|"The unprecedented successes of Google, Facebook, and then Microsoft exerted a palpable magnetism on the global economy, especially in the US, where the politics of lawlessness were most firmly entrenched. It far from Silicon Valley demonstrated their determination to compete for surveillance revenues. Among the first in this second wave were the telecom and cable companies that provide broadband service to millions of individuals and households. Although there is some debate about whether these companies can effectively compete with the established internet giants, the facts on the ground suggest that the ISPs are nonetheless determined to try.

1068|11|115|The largest of these corporations---Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast---made strategic acquisitions that signaled a shift away from their long-standing models of fees for service in favor of monetizing behavioral surplus.

1069|11|116|"Verizon---the largest telecom company in the US and the largest in the world as measured by market capitalization---publicly introduced its shift toward surveillance revenues in the spring of 2014, when an article in *Advertising Age* announced the company's move into mobile advertising. Verizon's VP of data marketing argued that such advertising had been limited by ""addressability... the growing difficulty of tracking consumers as they move between devices."" As one marketing expert complained, ""There isn't a []pervasive identity that tracks users from mobile applications and your mobile browser."" The article explained that Verizon had developed ""a cookie alternative for a marketing space vexed by the absence of cookies."" Verizon aimed to solve advertisers' tracking needs by assigning a hidden and undeletable tracking number, called a PrecisionID, to each Verizon user."|Chap 11, Para 116|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1070|11|117|In fact, Verizon's *incursion* had launched two years earlier in 2012 but had been carefully hidden from the public. That was probably because the ID enables the corporation to identify and monitor individuals' habits on their smartphones and tablets, generating behavioral surplus while bypassing customers' awareness. The tracker can neither be turned off nor evaded with private browsing or other privacy tools and controls. Whenever a Verizon subscriber visits a website or mobile app, the corporation and its partners use this hidden ID to aggregate and package behavioral data, all without customers' knowledge.|Chap 11, Para 117|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1071|11|118|"Verizon's indelible tracking capabilities provided a distinct advantage in the growing competition for behavioral surplus. Advertisers hungry to redefine your walk in the park as their ""marketing space"" could now reliably target ads to your phone on the strength of the corporation's indelible personal identifier. Verizon also entered into partnership with Turn, an advertising technology firm already notorious for the invention of an unusual ""zombie cookie"" or ""perma-cookie"" that immediately ""respawns"" when a user chooses to opt out of ad tracking or deletes tracking cookies. As a Verizon partner, the Turn zombie cookie attached itself to Verizon's secret tracking number, adding even more protection from discovery and scrutiny. Turn's chief ""privacy officer"" defended the arrangement, saying, ""We are trying to use the most persistent identifier that we can in order to do what we do."""|Chap 11, Para 118|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1072|11|119|"By the fall of 2014, Verizon's stealthy new claim on free raw material was outed by Jacob Hoffman-Andrews, a technologist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. An article in *Wired* called attention to Hoffman-Andrews' analysis of Verizon's surveillance program and his additional discovery that AT&T was using a similar tracking ID. The article quoted a Verizon spokesperson admitting, ""There's no way to turn it off."" Hoffman-Andrews observed that even when customers opt out of Verizon's targeted ads, its tracking ID persists, as the corporation bypasses or overrides all signals of a user's intentions, including the Do Not Track setting, Incognito and other []private browsing modes, and cookie deletion. The ID is then broadcast to every ""unencrypted website a Verizon customer visits from a mobile device. It allows third-party advertisers and websites to assemble a deep, permanent profile of visitors' web browsing habits without their consent."" Alarmed by the threat of fresh competition, Google, posing as a privacy advocate, launched a campaign for a new internet protocol that would prevent ""header injections"" such as Verizon's PrecisionID."|Chap 11, Para 119|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER

Hoffman-Andrews would eventually call the telecom's tactics ""a spectacular violation of Verizon users' privacy."" True as this may be, the corporation's tactical operations suggest an even more far-ranging development."|Chap 11, Para 120|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1074|11|121|"Verizon would not retreat from the territory already claimed with its incursion. The hidden ID would stay, and the company assured customers that ""it is unlikely that sites and ad entities will attempt to build customer profiles."" However, it didn't take long for experts to discover that Twitter's mobile advertising arm already relied on the Verizon ID to track Twitter users' behavior. Then computer scientist and legal scholar Jonathan Mayer found that Turn's zombie cookie sent and received data from more than thirty businesses, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo!, Twitter, Walmart, and WebMD. Mayer investigated both Verizon and Turn's opt-out policies and found both to be deceptive, concluding that every one of Verizon's public statements on the privacy and security of its tracking ID was false.

1075|11|122|Verizon's substantial entry into surveillance capitalism necessarily tethered the corporation's interests to the extraction imperative. We can see this in the way that Verizon discovered and implemented the dispossession cycle, moving rapidly through its sequence of tactical phases from incursion to redirection. Verizon's initial incursion bought it three years of internal experimentation and discovery. During that time it crossed the threshold of public awareness, beginning the gradual process of public *habituation* to its new practices. Once its strategies were public, it endured a barrage of critical news []articles and the scrutiny of privacy experts, but it also bought more time to explore revenue opportunities and supply route expansion. Public reaction to its incursion forced the corporation to map the next phases of the cycle.|Chap 11, Para 122|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1076|11|123|"Public pressure triggered the shift toward *adaptation* in early 2015. An FCC investigation into Verizon's illicit tracking practices had been launched a few months earlier.

The committee chastised Verizon and Turn for their ""seemingly"" deliberate ""violation of consumer privacy"" and ""circumvention of customer choice.""

He was president of Google's Americas sales division when, like Sheryl Sandberg before him, Armstrong left Google for AOL in 2009 with a profound grasp of AdWords' surveillance DNA and the determination to rescue AOL's balance sheet with surveillance capitalism gene therapy.

Verizon and AOL would now work together ""to deliver services that are more personalized and useful to you... we will combine Verizon's existing advertising programs... into the AOL Advertising Network. The combination will help make the ads you see more valuable across the different devices and services you use."" The new notice asserted that ""the privacy of our customers is important to us,"" though not important enough to compromise the extraction imperative and allow raw-material providers to challenge the corporation's dispossession program. Opt-out procedures were available but, as usual, complex, difficult to ascertain, and time-consuming.

Although Verizon agreed to relaunch its cookie on an opt-in basis, the settlement did not extend to AOL's advertising network, which is where the action had moved. Verizon's burgeoning new supply routes would remain unchallenged.

""Once we subscribe to an ISP,"" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler wrote, ""most of us have little flexibility to change our mind or avoid that network rapidly.""

""Scale is imperative,"" Armstrong had told journalists a year earlier. ""If you want to play in the Olympics you have to compete against Google and Facebook.""

1084|11|131|In a chilling epilogue to this chapter in the history of surveillance capitalism, on March 28, 2017, a newly elected Republican Congress voted in favor of a resolution to overturn the broadband privacy regulations over which the FCC had struggled just months earlier. The rules had required cable and phone companies to obtain meaningful consent before using personal information for ads and profiling. The companies understood, and they persuaded Republican senators, that the principle of *consent* would strike a serious blow []to the foundational mechanisms of the new capitalism: the legitimacy of unilateral surplus dispossession, ownership rights to surplus, decision rights over surplus, and the right to lawless space for the prosecution of these activities. To this end the resolution also prevented the FCC from seeking to establish similar protections in the future. Writing in the *New York Times,* Democratic FCC appointee Wheeler went to the heart of the problem:|Chap 11, Para 131|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER

1086|11|133|"The reversal meant that although federal laws protected the privacy of a telephone call, the same information transmitted by internet immediately enters the ISPs' surplus supply chains. This roust finally signaled the end of the myth of ""free."" The Faustian pact that had been sold to the world's internet users posed surveillance as the bitter price of free services such as Google's Search and Facebook's social network. This obfuscation is no longer tenable, as every consumer who pays his or her monthly telecom bill now also purchases the privilege of a remote and abstract but nevertheless rapacious digital strip search."|Chap 11, Para 133|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER

1088|11|135|"In another trend, surveillance in the interest of behavioral surplus capture and sale has become a service in its own right. Such companies are often referred to as ""software-as-a-service"" or SaaS, but they are more accurately termed ""surveillance as a service,"" or ""SVaaS."" For example, a new app-based approach to lending instantly establishes creditworthiness based on detailed mining of an individual's smartphone and other online behaviors, including []texts, e-mails, GPS coordinates, social media posts, Facebook profiles, retail transactions, and communication patterns. Data sources can include intimate details such as the frequency with which you charge your phone battery, the number of incoming messages you receive, if and when you return phone calls, how many contacts you have listed in your phone, how you fill out online forms, or how many miles you travel each day. These behavioral data yield nuanced patterns that predict the likelihood of loan default or repayment and thus enable continuous algorithmic development and refinement. Two economists who researched this approach discovered that these qualities of surplus produce a predictive model comparable to traditional credit scoring, observing that ""the method quantifies rich aspects of behavior typically considered 'soft' information, making it legible to formal institutions."" ""You're able to get in and really understand the daily life of these customers,"" explained the CEO of one lending company that analyzes 10,000 signals per customer."|Chap 11, Para 135|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1089|11|136|"Such methods were originally developed for markets in Africa to help the ""unbanked""---people without established credit---to qualify for loans. One lending group interviewed potential customers in low-income countries and concluded that it would be easy to exploit the already beleaguered poor: ""Most said they had no problem sharing personal details in exchange for much-needed funds."" But these app-based lending startups are typically developed and funded in Silicon Valley, and it is therefore not surprising that the same techniques have become part of a wider trend of exploiting American families that have been economically hollowed out by the financial crisis and neoliberalism's austerity medicine. As the *Wall Street Journal* reports, new startups such as Affirm, LendUp, and ZestFinance ""use data from sources such as social media, online behavior and data brokers to determine the creditworthiness of tens of thousands of U.S. consumers who don't have access to loans,"" more evidence that decision rights and the privacy they enable have become luxuries that too many people cannot afford."|Chap 11, Para 136|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1090|11|137|"Another example of surveillance-as-a-service is a firm that sells deep vetting of potential employees and tenants to employers and landlords. For instance, a prospective tenant receives a demand from her potential landlord that requires her to grant full access to all social media profiles. The service then ""scrapes your site activity,"" including entire conversation threads and private []messages, runs it through natural language processing and other analytic software, and finally spits out a report that catalogues everything from your personality to your ""financial stress level,"" including exposing protected status information such as pregnancy and age. There is no opportunity for affected individuals to view or contest information. As in the case of digital lenders, although a prospective tenant must formally ""opt in"" to the service, it is those who have less money and fewer options who are trapped in this Faustian bargain in which privacy is forfeit to social participation. ""People will give up their privacy to get something they want,"" celebrates the CEO of this service firm."|Chap 11, Para 137|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1091|11|138|"Another genre of SVaaS firms employs data science and machine learning to scour the internet for behavioral surplus about individuals, either to sell it or to analyze and fabricate it into lucrative prediction products. Legal scholar Frank Pasquale describes this as ""the dark market for personal data."" For example, hiQ markets its prediction products to corporate human resources professionals. It scrapes the web for information related to a client's employees, including social media and public available data; then its ""data science engine extracts strong signals from that noise that indicate someone may be a flight risk."" Machine learning models assign risk scores to each employee, enabling clients ""to pinpoint with laser-like accuracy the employees that are highest risk...."" The company claims that it provides ""a crystal ball"" and that its predictions are ""virtually identical"" to observed turnover. With hiQ's information, companies can preemptively intervene. They might make an effort to retain an employee, or they may choose to preemptively terminate someone who is predicted to be a ""flight risk."""|Chap 11, Para 138|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1092|11|139|"Another example is Safegraph, a company that partners with all those apps that are tracking your behavior to amass ""high precision/low false positive"" data collected ""in background from large populations."" According to the *Washington Post,* the company collected 17 trillion location markers from 10 million smartphones in November 2016 alone, data that were sold to two university researchers, among others, for a detailed study of political influences on patterns of family behavior on Thanksgiving Day that year. Despite the widely employed euphemisms of ""anonymization"" and ""deidentification,"" Safegraph tracks individual devices and the movement of their owners throughout the day, producing data that are sufficiently granular to be able to identify individuals' home locations."|Chap 11, Para 139|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1093|11|140|[]Surveillance capitalism was born digital, but as we shall see in following chapters, it is no longer confined to born-digital companies. This logic for translating investment into revenue is highly adaptive and exceptionally lucrative as long as raw-material supplies are free and law is kept at bay. The rapid migration to surveillance revenues that is now underway recalls the late-twentieth-century shift from revenues derived from goods and services to revenues derived from mastering the speculative and shareholder-value-maximizing strategies of financial capitalism. Back then, every company was forced to obey the same commandments: shrink head count, offshore manufacturing and service facilities, reduce expenditures on product and service quality, diminish commitments to employees and consumers, and automate the customer interface, all radical cost-reduction strategies designed to support the firm's share price, which was held hostage to an increasingly narrow and exclusionary view of the firm and its role in society.|Chap 11, Para 140|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER
1094|11|141|"As competition for surveillance assets heats up, new laws of motion rise to salience. Eventually, these will shape an even-more-merciless imperative to predict future behavior with greater certainty and detail, forcing the whole project to break loose from the virtual world in favor of the one that we call ""real."" In Part II we follow this migration to the real world, as competitive dynamics force the expansion of supply operations and an ever-more-complex extraction architecture reaches both further and deeper into new territories of human experience."|Chap 11, Para 141|11 TWO SPECIES OF POWER

The studies that this group has produced are a contemporary signal of an increasingly taken-for-granted worldview among data scientists whose computational theories and innovations exist in dynamic interaction with the progress of surveillance capitalism, as in the case of Picard's affective []computing and Paradiso's digital omniscience. However, few consider the social ramifications of their work with Pentland's insight and conviction, providing us with an invaluable opportunity to critically explore the governance assumptions, societal principles, and social processes that define an instrumentarian society.

He is also a hands-on architect of instrumentarianism's practical architecture and computational challenges. Pentland refers to his theory of society as ""social physics,"" a conception that confirms him as this century's B. F. Skinner, by way of Planck, Meyer, and MacKay. And although Pentland never mentions the old behaviorist, Pentland's book, *Social Physics,* summons Skinner's social vision into the twenty-first century, now fulfilled by the instruments that eluded Skinner in his lifetime.

Up there, any sense of ""we"" quickly dissolves into the viewpoint of the Other-One, and it is this angle of observation that founded Pentland's science as he learned to apply MacKay's principles of remote observation and telestimulation to humans: ""If you think about people across the room talking, you can tell a lot.... It's like watching beavers from outer space, like Jane Goodall watching gorillas. You observe from a distance.""

1106|12|15|"Skinner bitterly lamented the absence of ""instruments and methods"" for the study of human behavior comparable to those available to physicists. As if in response, Pentland and his students have spent the last two decades determined to invent the instruments and methods that can transform all of human behavior, especially social behavior, into highly predictive math. An early milestone was a 2002 collaboration with then-doctoral student Tanzeem Choudhury, in which the coauthors wrote, ""As far as we know, there are currently no available methods to automatically model face-to-face interactions. This absence is probably due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable measurements from real-world interactions within a community....

Pentland had insisted that even the relatively new field of ""data mining"" could not capture the ""real action"" of conversations and face-to-face interactions necessary for a trenchant and comprehensive grasp of social behavior.

Their analyses produced detailed portraits of individual and group life: the ""social system,"" as the authors called it. They were able to specify regular temporal and spatial patterns of location, activity, and communication-use patterns, which together enabled predictions of up to 90 percent accuracy regarding where someone was likely to be and what that person was likely to be doing within the hour, as well as highly accurate predictions about an individual's colleagues, casual friends, and close relationships.

1124|12|33|"[]Pentland understands his experiments and paid interventions in workplace settings as emblematic of the larger challenges of social relations in an instrumentarian society. Once again we see the intended path from the economic to the social domain. Those instrumented office workers function as living labs for the translation of instrumentarian relations to the wider society. Pentland appeared in 2016 at a conference organized by Singularity University, a Silicon Valley hub of instrumentarian ideology funded in part by Larry Page. An interviewer tasked to write about Pentland explains, ""Though people are one of the most valuable assets in an organization, many companies are still approaching management with a 20th century mentality.... Pentland saw the factor that was always messing things up was---the people."" Like Nadella, Pentland described his aims as developing the social systems that would work along the same lines as the machine systems, using behavioral data flows to judge the ""correctness"" of action patterns and to intervene when it is necessary to change ""bad"" action to ""correct"" action. ""If people aren't interacting correctly and information isn't spreading correctly,"" Pentland warns, ""people make bad decisions.... What you're trying to do is make a human-machine symbiote, where the humans understand more about the network of interactions because of the computers, and the computers are able to understand more about how humans work.""

Pentland articulated his ambitions for the capabilities and objectives of this new milieu in a series of papers, published primarily between 2011 and 2014, but one remarkable 2011 essay of which he is the sole author stands out: ""Society's Nervous System: Building Effective Government, Energy, and Public Health Systems."""|Chap 12, Para 34|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1126|12|35|"Pentland begins the report by announcing the institutional bona fides of this work: ""Drawing on a unique, multi-year collaboration with the heads of major IT, wireless, hardware, health, and financial firms, as well as the heads of American, EU, and other regulatory organizations, and a variety []of NGOs \[a footnote here indicates the World Economic Forum\], I describe the potential for pervasive and mobile sensing and computing over the next decade...."" From there, his reasoning leaps across a range of inferences to stitch together a crucial rationale for a totalistic society constructed, sustained, and directed by instrumentarian power. The initial premise is reasonable enough: industrial-age technology once revolutionized the world with reliable systems for water, food, waste, energy, transportation, police, health care, education, and so forth, but these systems are now hopelessly ""old,"" ""centralized,"" ""obsolete,"" and ""unsustainable."""|Chap 12, Para 35|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1127|12|36|"New digital systems are required that must be ""integrated,"" ""holistic,"" ""responsive,"" ""dynamic,"" and ""self-regulating"": ""We need a radical rethinking of societies' systems. We must create a nervous system for humanity that maintains the stability of our societies' systems throughout the globe."" Referring to the progress of ubiquitous computational sensing devices able to govern complex machine processes and information flows, Pentland observes that the ""sensing"" technologies necessary for this nervous system are ""already in place."" Even in 2011, Pentland understood that the basic contours of Big Other were up and running, describing it as a ""world-spanning living organism"" in which ""wireless traffic systems, security sensors, and especially mobile telephone networks are combining to become intelligent reactive systems with sensors serving as their eyes and ears... the evolution... will continue at a quickening speed... devices will have more sensors...."""|Chap 12, Para 36|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1128|12|37|"But Pentland saw a problem. Although ubiquitous technologies are well on the way to solving the technical challenges of a global nervous system, Big Other will not be complete until it also understands *human behavior* on a global scale: ""What is missing... are the dynamic models of demand and reaction,"" along with an architecture that guarantees ""safety, stability, and efficiency.... The models required must describe *human* demand and reactions, since humans are at the core of all of these systems... the necessary observations are observations of individual behavior...."""|Chap 12, Para 37|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER

1131|12|40|"In a style reminiscent of Larry Page's rejection of ""old laws,"" Pentland is equally critical of a range of concepts and frameworks inherited from the Enlightenment and political economics. Pentland insists that the ""old"" social categories of status, class, education, race, gender, and generation are obsolete, as irrelevant as the energy, food, and water systems that he wants to replace. Those categories describe societies through the lens of history, power, and politics, but Pentland prefers ""populations"" to societies, ""statistics"" to meaning, and ""computation"" to law. He sees the ""stratification of the population"" coded not by race, income, occupation, or gender but rather by ""behavior patterns"" that produce ""behavior subgroups"" and a new ""behavior demographics"" that can predict disease, financial risk, consumer preferences, and political views with ""between 5 and 10 *times* the accuracy"" of the standard measures."|Chap 12, Para 40|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER

His answers do not lie in persuasion or education but in behavioral modification. He says we need ""new predictive theories of human decision making"" as well as ""incentive mechanism design,"" an idea that is comparable to Skinner's ""schedules of reinforcement."" Regarding how to get humans to follow the plan, Pentland offers the principle of ""social influence"" to explain the design mechanisms through which millions of human beings can be herded toward the guaranteed outcomes []of safety, stability, and efficiency. He refers to his own studies, in which ""the problems of industry and government"" can largely be explained by the pattern of information transfer, especially how people influence and mimic one another."|Chap 12, Para 41|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1133|12|42|"This notion of social influence is a significant piece in Pentland's puzzle that anticipates a great deal of what is to come. Pentland understands that Big Other is not only an architecture that monitors and controls things. Big Other's instrumentation and data flows also make people mutually visible to one another, from the updates on your breakfast to the population flows in cities. Back in 2011, Pentland enthused, ""Revolutionary new... infrastructures are providing us with a God's eye view of ourselves."" The aim is a computer-mediated society where our mutual visibility becomes the habitat in which we attune to one another, producing social patterns based on imitation that can be manipulated for confluence, just as the logic of the machine hive suggests."|Chap 12, Para 42|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1134|12|43|"Regarding incentives, Pentland outlines a principle of ""social efficiency,"" which means that participation must provide value to the individual but also *to the system as a whole.* For the sake of this wholeness, it is believed, each of us will surrender to a totally measured life of instrumentarian order. Sounding ever so much like Eric Schmidt and Larry Page with their silky promises of Google's all-knowing preemptive magic, Pentland believes that what we stand to lose is more than compensated for by the social rewards of efficient corporations and governments and the individual rewards that are simply *magic,* as he baldly appeals to second-modernity stress:"|Chap 12, Para 43|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER

Pentland transforms Skinner's fusty, odd utopia into something that sounds sophisticated, magical, and plausible, largely because it resonates with the waves of applied utopistics that wash over our lives each day. In completing Skinner, Pentland fashions more than an updated portrait of a behaviorist utopia. He outlines the principles of a full-blown instrumentarian society based on the pervasive outfitting and measurement of human behavior for the purposes of modification, control, and---in light of surveillance capitalism's commercial dominance of the networked sphere---profit.|Chap 12, Para 45|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER

If we had a 'god's eye,' an all seeing view, then we could potentially arrive at a true understanding of how society works and take steps to fix our problems."""|Chap 12, Para 46|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1138|12|47|"Pentland is sanguine on this point: total knowledge is within reach.

The data mostly already exists.""* The right to the future tense---and with it social trust, authority, and politics---is surrendered to Big Other and the transcendent computational systems that rule society under the watchful eye of a group that Pentland calls ""we."" He never defines this ""we,"" which imposes an us-them relationship, introducing the exclusivity of the shadow text and its one-way mirror. It is an omission that haunts his text.

The second is ""social learning,"" in which people imitate one another until new ideas become population-wide habits. (Social learning is defined as a mathematical relationship derived from ""how an entity's state impacts other entities' states and vice versa."") Pentland notes that social learning is ""rooted in statistical physics and machine learning.""

These principles echo Skinner's social theory of a behaviorally controlled society, in which knowledge replaces freedom. In exploring each of the five, I compare Pentland's statements to Skinner's own formulations on these topics. As we shall see, Skinner's once reviled thinking now defines this frontier of instrumentarian power.|Chap 12, Para 49|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1141|12|51|"Skinner had emphasized the need for an urgent shift to a collective perspective and values. ""The intentional design of a culture and the control of human behavior it implies are essential if the human species is to continue to develop,"" he wrote in *Beyond Freedom & Dignity.* The imperative to shift human behavior toward the greater good was already clear in *Walden Two,* where Frazier, its protagonist, asserts, ""The fact is, we not only *can* control human behavior, we *must*."" Ultimately, this challenge was understood as an engineering problem. ""And what are the techniques, the engineering practices, that will shape the behavior of the members of a group so that they will function smoothly for the benefit of all?"" Frazier asks. Skinner advocated, via Frazier, that the virtue of a ""planned society"" is ""to keep intelligence on the right track, for the good of society rather than of the intelligent individual....

Like Skinner, he is emphatic that these attachments to a bygone era of imperfect knowledge threaten to undermine the prospect of a perfectly engineered future society: ""We cannot ignore the public goods that such a nervous system could provide...."" Pentland avoids the question ""Whose greater good?"" How is the greater good determined when surveillance capitalism owns the machines and the means of behavioral modification? ""Goodness"" arrives already oriented toward the interests of the owners of the means of behavioral modification and the clients whose guaranteed outcomes they seek to achieve.

These new mathematical analyses not only reveal the deep ""mechanisms of social interactions"" (Skinner's ""special capacities of the group"") but also combine with ""our newly acquired massive amounts of behavior data"" in order to reveal the patterns of causality that make it possible to ""engineer better social systems,"" all of it based on ""unprecedented instrumentation."""|Chap 12, Para 61|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER

Most important, instrumentation makes it possible for those with the God view to modify others' behavior. The data provide a ""reliable prediction of how changing any of these variables will change the performance of all the people in the network"" and thus achieve the optimum performance of Skinner's superorganism. This mathematics of idea flow is the basis for Pentland's version of a ""plan"" that dictates the targets and objectives of behavior change.

Any form of distinction between persons undermines the harmony of the whole and its capacity to bend to collective purpose. Frazier acknowledges that you cannot coerce people into doing the right thing. The solution is far more subtle and sophisticated, based upon scientifically calibrated schedules of reinforcement: ""Instead you have to set up certain behavioral processes which will lead the individual to design his own 'good' conduct....

We can leverage those exchanges to generate social pressure for change."" Social media is critical to establishing these tuning capabilities, Pentland believes, because this is the environment in which social pressure can best be controlled, directed, manipulated, and scaled."|Chap 12, Para 67|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER

For example, in the corporation's 61-million-person voting experiment, Pentland sees confirmation that social pressure can be effectively instrumentalized in social networks, especially among people with ""strong ties"": ""The knowledge that our face-to-face friends had already voted generated enough social pressure that it convinced people to vote.""

In all of these populations, the collective exerts pressure on each organism to go with the flow, stay with the herd, return to the hive, and take flight with the flock.

Instead, Pentland subscribes to the label *Homo imitans* to convey that it is mimicry, not empathy, and certainly not politics, which defines human existence. The term itself derives from studies of infant learning, but for Pentland it is a fitting explanation of all human behavior all the time: an assertion, like Skinner's, that control always rests with society.

The politics and economics of that destiny, which is to say the authority and power that found and sustain it, do not require specification because the machines and their math transcend these once fundamental coordinates of human society.

In *Beyond Freedom & Dignity,* Skinner freely displayed his contempt for this most transcendent ideal of the Sartrean age: the will to will oneself into first-person voice and action. Skinner argued that the differences between humans and other species are greatly exaggerated, and he would have found Pentland entirely justified in his rejection of the individual in favor of the distant, computer-mediated gaze. Beavers or people, the variance hardly matters once we shed the destructive fiction of individual autonomy. The surrender of the individual to manipulation by the planners clears the way for a safe and prosperous future built on the forfeit of freedom for knowledge. Skinner was unrelenting on this point:|Chap 12, Para 81|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1168|12|82|:::  What is being abolished is autonomous man---the inner man, the homunculus, the possessing demon, the man defended by the literatures of freedom and dignity. His abolition has long been overdue.... He has been constructed from our ignorance, and as our understanding increases, the very stuff of which he is composed vanishes... and it must do so if it is to prevent the abolition of the human species. To man qua man we readily say good riddance. Only by dispossessing him can we turn... from the inferred to the observed, from the miraculous to the natural, from the inaccessible to the manipulable. :::|Chap 12, Para 82|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1169|12|83|"The long-overdue death of individuality finally dispels the distracting fictions that fetishize the notions of freedom and dignity. The twentieth-century behaviorist from Harvard and the twenty-first-century data scientist from MIT agree that the notion of free will is but another unfortunate hangover from a dark age when science had not yet demonstrated that, as Skinner says, we live ""under the control of a social environment"" that ""millions of others... have constructed."" The blunt behaviorist delivers his final truth: ""A person does not act upon the world, the world acts upon him."""|Chap 12, Para 83|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1170|12|84|"[]In a lecture at Google that garnered enthusiastic applause, Pentland flattered the audience by signaling that the digital cognoscenti will easily accept the obsolescence of the individual as a necessary fate. ""What about free will?"" he asked the audience in Mountain View. ""That may not have occurred to *you,* but that's a traditional thing to ask."" He went on to explain that most human behavior---from political views to spending choices to the music that people listen to---is predicted by ""what's cool to do... exposure to what other people do."" Many people reject this idea, he noted, because ""it's not the rhetoric in our society."" Then he assured the Googlers, ""You guys are the last people to be saying this to, because you guys are like the best and smartest in the world."" For such people as these, Pentland appeared to say, the death of the individual is yesterday's news:"|Chap 12, Para 84|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1171|12|85|:::  So you've heard about rational individuals. And everybody rags on the rational part. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to rag on the individual part, OK? Because I don't think we are individuals. What we desire, the ways we learn to go about doing it, what's valuable, are consensual things... individual incentives... that's part of this mindset that comes from the 1700s... the action is not between our ears. The action is in our social networks, OK? We are a social species. :::|Chap 12, Para 85|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1172|12|86|"Pentland's vision is Skinner's vision, now standing on the shoulders of Big Other with its Big Data and its Big Math. These are the resources of the smart machines required to divine the ""correct"" answers. Such is Pentland's resonance with Skinner's social theory that without ever titled ""Social Physics Versus Free Will and Dignity."""|Chap 12, Para 86|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1173|12|87|If we are to annihilate and bury the individual as an existential reality, philosophical idea, and political ideal, then this death should at least merit the gravitas of an ancient Greek funerary ritual. The existence of the individual is, after all, an achievement carved from millennia of human suffering and sacrifice. Instead, Pentland brushes it aside as just another debugging of humanity's computer code, a much-needed upgrade to the outdated software that is the long human story.|Chap 12, Para 87|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1174|12|88|"[]Unlike Skinner, though, Pentland is careful to round the square, perhaps in the hope of evading a withering review by the likes of Noam Chomsky. (In ""The Case Against B. F. Skinner,"" as you may recall from [Chapter 10](chapter015.xhtml), Chomsky famously denounced Skinner as ""vacuous"" and ""devoid of scientific content,"" and he assessed the work as burdened with misconceptions that ""virtually guarantee failure."") Pentland sidesteps the risks of Skinner's jeremiad by taking a softer tone: ""Some people react negatively to the phrase social physics, because they feel that it implies that people are machines without free will and without the ability to move independently of our role in society."" Like Meyer, Pentland acknowledges that humans have a ""capacity for independent thought"" but insists that social physics ""does not need to try to account for it."" As Pentland sees it, the problem is not that ""independent thought"" is omitted from the picture but rather that ""internal, unobservable"" thought processes are just friction that ""will occasionally emerge to defeat our best social physics models."" Fortunately, the models are not really in danger because ""the data tell us that deviations from our regular social patterns occur only a few percent of the time."" The autonomous individual is but a statistical blip, a slip of the pen that is easily overridden in the march toward confluent action and someone's greater good."|Chap 12, Para 88|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1175|12|89|"In this vein, Professor Pentland does not ignore issues like privacy and social trust. He actively advocates solutions to these problems, but the solutions he pursues are already tailored to the intensification of a ""data-driven"" instrumentarian society. Pentland's approach recalls the early conviction of his former doctoral student Rosalind Picard that societal challenges are not insurmountable, that new technical solutions will resolve any problems, and that ""safeguards can be developed."" Two decades later Picard's view had a darker cast, but Pentland expresses little trace of doubt. For example, Pentland works with influential institutions like the World Economic Forum to craft ""a new deal on data"" that favors individual ""ownership"" of personal information but does not question the ubiquitous rendition of such personal information in the first instance. Data ownership, he believes, will create financial incentives for participation in a market-oriented instrumentarian society. Like Skinner, Pentland assumes that the sheer weight of incentives and ubiquitous connection, monitoring, and tuning will eventually wear down []older sensibilities such as the interest in privacy. ""The New Deal gives customers a stake in the new data economy; that will bring first greater stability and then eventually greater profitability as people become more comfortable sharing data."""|Chap 12, Para 89|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1176|12|90|"In Pentland's view of data ownership, certainty machines like blockchain, which relies on complex encryption and algorithms to create a decentralized tamper-proof database, are commandeered to bypass social trust. He advocates systems ""that live everywhere and nowhere, protecting and processing the data of millions of people, and executing on millions of internet computers."" One important study of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that relies on blockchain, suggests that such machine solutions both express and contribute to the general erosion of the social fabric in ways that are both consistent with instrumentarianism and further pave the way for its success. Information scholars Primavera De Filippi and Benjamin Loveluck conclude that contrary to popular belief, ""Bitcoin is neither anonymous nor privacy-friendly... anyone with a copy of the blockchain can see the history of all Bitcoin transactions... every transaction ever done on the Bitcoin network can be traced back to its origin."" Such systems rely on ""perfect information,"" but the kinds of coordination processes that build open democratic societies, such as ""social trust"" or ""loyalty,"" are ""expunged"" in favor of ""a profoundly market-driven approach."" Like Varian, Pentland does not acknowledge the social and political implications of such systems, which are in any case irrelevant to an instrumentarian future in which democracy and social trust are superseded by the certainty machines, their priests, and their owners."|Chap 12, Para 90|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1177|12|91|"Surveillance capitalism grew to dominance during the years that Pentland has argued for his ""New Deal,"" even as it benefitted from his theoretical and commercial innovations. During those same years, as we have seen, Picard's ""affective computing"" fell to the surveillance paradigm. Nevertheless, Professor Pentland is sanguine that surveillance capitalism can easily be pushed aside by market forces, despite its concentrations of knowledge, rights, and power; its unilateral control of the shadow text; and its dominant position in the division of learning in society. ""It simply requires that creative businesspeople harness the will of consumers in order to construct a value proposition better than the current steal-all-your-data paradigm. We've just got to push on through."" Power, politics, and law do not enter into the []equation, presumably because they are already obsolete in the social vision under construction here."|Chap 12, Para 91|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1178|12|92|It is no surprise that capitalism shapes social relations. A century ago it was the new means of mass production that fashioned mass society in its image. Today, surveillance capitalism offers a new template for our future: the machine hive in which our freedom is forfeit to perfect knowledge administered for others' profit. This is an unheralded social revolution that is difficult to discern in the fog of utopian rhetoric and high-speed applied utopistics conjured by leading surveillance capitalists and the many communities of practice---from developers to data scientists---that enable and sustain the dominance of the commercial surveillance project.|Chap 12, Para 92|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1179|12|93|Surveillance capitalists work hard to camouflage their purpose as they master the uses of instrumentarian power to shape our behavior while evading our awareness. That is why Google conceals the operations that turn us into the objects of its search and Facebook distracts us from the fact that our beloved connections are essential to the profit and power that flow from its network ubiquity and totalistic knowledge.|Chap 12, Para 93|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1180|12|94|"Pentland's experimental work and theoretical analyses perform an important political and social function in piercing this fog. They map the tactical and conceptual pathways of instrumentarian society that place the means of behavior modification at the heart of this social system, founded on the scientific and technological control of collective behavior and administered by a specialist class. In China the state appears determined to ""own"" this complex, but in the West it is largely owned and operated by surveillance capital."|Chap 12, Para 94|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1181|12|95|Instrumentarian society defines the ultimate institutionalization of a pathological division of learning. *Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?* Here too the comparison with China is useful. An abnormal division of learning marks both China and the West. In China the state vies with its surveillance capitalists for control. In the US and Europe the state works with and through the surveillance capitalists to accomplish its aims. It is the []private companies who have scaled the rock face to command the heights. They sit at the pinnacle of the division of learning, having amassed unprecedented and exclusive wealth, information, and expertise on the strength of their dispossession of our behavior. They are making their dreams come true. Not even Skinner could have aspired to this condition.|Chap 12, Para 95|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1182|12|96|The social principles of instrumentarianism's third modernity represent a stark break with the legacies and ideals of the liberal order. Instrumentarian society is a topsy-turvy fun-house-mirror world in which everything that we have cherished is turned upside down and inside out. Pentland doubles down on the illiberality of behavioral economics. In his hands the ideology of human frailty is not merely cause for contempt but a justification for the death of individuality. Self-determination and autonomous moral judgment, generally regarded as the bulwark of civilization, are recast as a threat to collective well-being. Social pressure, well-known to psychologists for its dangerous production of obedience and conformity, is elevated to the highest good as the means to extinguish the unpredictable influences of autonomous thought and moral judgment.|Chap 12, Para 96|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1183|12|97|These new architectures feed on our fellow feeling to exploit and ultimately to suffocate the individually sensed inwardness that is the wellspring of personal autonomy and moral judgment, the first-person voice, the will to will, and the sense of an inalienable right to the future tense. That we vibrate to one another should be a life-enhancing fact, but this third modernity amplifies our mutual vibration to an excruciating pitch. In the milieu of total instrumentation, it is less that we resonate to one another's presence and more that we drown in its inescapability.|Chap 12, Para 97|12 BIG OTHER AND THE RISE OF INSTRUMENTARIAN POWER
1184|12|98|"Instrumentarianism reimagines society as a hive to be monitored and tuned for guaranteed outcomes, but this tells us nothing of the lived experience of its members. What are the consequences of life lived in the hive, where one is perceived as an ""other"" to the surveillance capitalists, designers, and tuners who impose their instruments and methods? How and when do we each become an organism among organisms to ourselves and to one another, and with what result? The answers to these questions are not all guesswork. We can begin by asking our children. Without knowing it, we sent the least formed and most vulnerable among us to scout the hive and settle its wilderness.

1185|13|4|"Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt credits Hal Varian's early examination of the firm's ad auctions with providing the eureka moment that clarified the true nature of Google's business: ""All of a sudden, we realized we were in the auction business."" Larry Page is credited with a very different and far more profound answer to the question ""What is Google?"" Douglas Edwards recounts a 2001 session with the founders that probed their answers to that precise query. It was Page who ruminated, ""If we did have a category, it would be *personal information....* The places you've seen. Communications.... Sensors are really cheap.... Storage is cheap. Cameras are cheap. People will generate enormous amounts of data.... Everything you've ever heard or seen or experienced will become searchable.

1186|13|5|"Page's vision perfectly reflects the history of capitalism, marked by taking things that live outside the market sphere and declaring their new life as market commodities. In historian Karl Polanyi's 1944 grand narrative of the ""great transformation"" to a self-regulating market economy, he described the origins of this translation process in three astonishing and crucial mental []inventions that he called ""commodity fictions."" The first was that human life could be subordinated to market dynamics and reborn as ""labor"" to be bought and sold. The second was that nature could be translated into the market and reborn as ""land"" or ""real estate."" The third was that exchange could be reborn as ""money."" Nearly eighty years earlier, Karl Marx had described the taking of lands and natural resources as the original ""big bang"" that ignited modern capital formation, calling it ""primitive accumulation."""|Chap 13, Para 5|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1187|13|6|"The philosopher Hannah Arendt complicated both Polanyi's and Marx's notion. She observed that primitive accumulation wasn't just a one-time primal explosion that gave birth to capitalism. Rather, it is a recurring phase in a repeating cycle as more aspects of the social and natural world are subordinated to the market dynamic. Marx's ""original sin of simple robbery,"" she wrote, ""had eventually to be repeated lest the motor of capital accumulation suddenly die down."""|Chap 13, Para 6|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1188|13|7|"In our time of pro-market ideology and practice, this cycle has become so pervasive that we eventually fail to notice its audacity or contest its claims.

The list grows longer each day."|Chap 13, Para 7|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1189|13|8|"Social theorist David Harvey builds on Arendt's insight with his notion of ""accumulation by dispossession"": ""What accumulation by dispossession does is to release a set of assets... at very low (and in some instances zero) cost. Overaccumulated capital can seize hold of such assets and immediately turn them to profitable use."" He adds that entrepreneurs who are determined to ""join the system"" and enjoy ""the benefits of capital accumulation"" are often the ones who drive this process of dispossession into new, undefended territories."|Chap 13, Para 8|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1190|13|9|"Page grasped that human experience could be Google's virgin wood, that it could be extracted at no extra cost online and at very low cost out in the real world, where ""sensors are really cheap."" Once extracted, it is rendered as behavioral data, producing a surplus that forms the basis of a wholly new class of market exchange. Surveillance capitalism originates in this act of *digital dispossession,* brought to life by the impatience of over-accumulated investment and two entrepreneurs who wanted to join the system. This is the lever that moved Google's world and shifted it toward profit."|Chap 13, Para 9|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY

These include (1) the relentless pursuit and defense of the founders' ""freedom"" through corporate control and an insistence on the right to lawless space; (2) the shelter of specific historical circumstances, including the policies and juridical orientation of the neoliberal paradigm and the state's urgent interest in the emerging capabilities of behavioral surplus analysis and prediction in the aftermath of the September 2001 terror attacks; and (3) the intentional construction of fortifications in the worlds of politics and culture, designed to protect the kingdom and deflect any close scrutiny of its practices."|Chap 13, Para 15|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY

The two would control the super-class ""B"" voting stock, shares that each carried ten votes, as compared to the ""A"" class of shares, which each carried only one vote. This arrangement inoculated Page and Brin from market and investor pressures, as Page wrote in the ""Founder's Letter"" issued with the IPO: ""In the transition to public ownership, we have set up a corporate structure that will make it harder for outside parties to take over or influence Google....

Page had succeeded Schmidt as CEO in 2011, and the current leaders would handpick future leaders: ""We're fine with Larry... same circus, same clowns... it's the same people... all of us who built Google have the same view, and I am sure our successors will have the same view."""|Chap 13, Para 17|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY

But machines are only as smart as the volume of their diet allows. Thus, Google and Facebook vied to become the ubiquitous net positioned to capture the swarming schools of behavioral surplus flowing from every computer-mediated direction.

By 2009, a canny Forrester Research media analyst had unpacked the mystery: ""It actually becomes worth the additional value because Google can tie all of its advertising expertise and search traffic into YouTube... it ensures that these millions and millions of viewers are coming to a Google-owned site rather than someone's else's site....

Consistent with the extraction imperative, Zuckerberg told investors that he would not consider driving revenue until the service reaches ""billions"" of users.

This market form must either gird itself for perpetual conflict with the democratic process or find new ways to infiltrate, seduce, and bend democracy to its ends if it is to fulfill its own inner logic.

1214|13|33|These claims to lawless space are remarkably similar to those of the robber barons of an earlier century. Like the men at Google, the []late-nineteenth-century titans claimed undefended territory for their own interests, declared the righteousness of their self-authorizing prerogatives, and defended their new capitalism from democracy at any cost. At least in the US case, we have been here before.|Chap 13, Para 33|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1215|13|34|"Economic historians describe the dedication to lawlessness among the Gilded Age ""robber barons"" for whom Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism played the same role that Hayek, Jensen, and even Ayn Rand play for today's digital barons. In the same way that surveillance capitalists excuse their corporations' unprecedented concentrations of information and wealth as the unavoidable result of ""network effects"" and ""winner-take-all"" markets, the Gilded Age industrialists cited Spencer's specious, pseudoscientific ""survival of the fittest"" as proof of a divine plan intended to put society's wealth in the hands of its most aggressively competitive individuals."|Chap 13, Para 34|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1216|13|35|"The Gilded Age millionaires, like today's surveillance capitalists, stood on the frontier of a vast discontinuity in the means of production with nothing but blank territory in which to invent a new industrial capitalism free from constraints on the use of labor, the nature of working conditions, the extent of environmental destruction, the sourcing of raw materials, or even the quality of their own products. And like their twenty-first-century counterparts, they did not hesitate to exploit the very law that they despised, flying the banner of ""private property"" and ""freedom of contract,"" much as surveillance capitalists march under the flag of freedom of speech as the justification for unobstructed technological ""progress,"" a topic to which we shall return."|Chap 13, Para 35|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1217|13|36|"Imbued with the conviction that ""the state had neither right nor reason to interfere in the workings of the economy,"" the Gilded Age millionaires joined forces to defend the ""rights of capital"" and limit the role of elected representatives in setting policy or developing legislation. There was no need for law, they argued, when one had the ""law of evolution,"" the ""laws of capital,"" and the ""laws of industrial society."" John Rockefeller insisted that his outsized oil fortune was the result of ""the natural law of trade development."" Jay Gould, when questioned by Congress on the need for federal regulation of railroad rates, replied that rates were already regulated by ""the laws of supply and demand, production and consumption."" The millionaires mobilized in 1896 to defeat the populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan, who had []vowed to tether economic policy to the political realm, including regulating the railroads and protecting the people from ""robbery and oppression."""|Chap 13, Para 36|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1218|13|37|"The bottom line for Gilded Age business elites was that the most effective way to protect the original sin of that economic era was, as David Nasaw put it, ""to circumscribe democracy."" They did this by lavishly funding their own political candidates as well as through the careful honing and aggressive dissemination of an ideological attack on the very notion of democracy's right to interfere in the economic realm. Their industries were to be ""self-regulating"": free to follow their own evolutionary laws. ""Democracy,"" they preached, ""had its limits, beyond which voters and their elected representatives dared not trespass lest economic calamity befall the nation."" In our discussion of ""fortifications"" we'll see that Google revived all of these strategies and more. But first we explore the unique circumstances that sheltered the young company and protected its discovery of human experience as a limitless resource ripe for the taking."|Chap 13, Para 37|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1219|13|38|Google's leaders were also favored by historical circumstance. Both Google and the wider surveillance capitalist project were the beneficiaries of two developments that contributed to a uniquely sheltering habitat for the surveillance mutation. The first is the neoliberal capture of the governmental machinery for oversight and regulation of the US economy, the framework of which we discussed in [Chapter 2](chapter002.xhtml).|Chap 13, Para 38|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1220|13|39|"A fascinating study by University of California law professor Jodi Short empirically illustrates the role of neoliberal ideology as one important explanation for Google's ambitions and successful defense of lawless territory. Short analyzed 1,400 law review articles on the subject of regulation, all published between 1980 and 2005. As the influence of Hayek and Friedman predicts, the dominant theme of this literature was ""the coercive nature of administrative government"" and the systematic conflation of industry regulation with ""tyranny"" and ""authoritarianism."" According to this worldview, all regulation is burdensome, and bureaucracy must be repudiated as a form of human domination. Short []observes that during the sample decades these fears were even more influential in shaping regulatory approaches than rational arguments about cost and efficiency, and she identifies two points of origin for these anxieties."|Chap 13, Para 39|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1221|13|40|"The first source was in the US business community's opposition to New Deal reforms, which, not unlike the propaganda of the Gilded Age millionaires, cast resistance to regulation as a ""righteous fight to defend democracy from dictatorship."" A second source was the dread of totalitarianism and collectivism incited by World War II and the cold war, a direct inheritance from Hayek. These defensive themes infiltrated and reshaped US political thought, and they gradually transformed policy makers' assumptions about the regulatory role of the state."|Chap 13, Para 40|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1222|13|41|"Short found several suggested remedies for ""coercive"" governmental regulation in the literature, but the most salient, especially after 1996---the very years when digital technology and the internet were becoming mainstream---was ""self-regulation."" The idea here is that firms set their own standards, monitor their own compliance with those standards, and even judge their own conduct in order to ""voluntarily report and remediate violations."" By the time of Google's public offering in 2004, self-regulation was fully enshrined within government and across the business community as the single most effective tool for regulation without coercion and the antidote to any inclination toward collectivism and the centralization of power."|Chap 13, Para 41|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1223|13|42|"This neoliberal legacy was a windfall for the new surveillance capitalists. As another legal scholar, Frank Pasquale, observed, it produced a model that treated privacy as a competitive good, assuming that ""consumers"" engage only with services that offer the level of privacy they seek. Regulatory interference, according to this view, would only undermine competitive diversity. It also credits the ""notice and consent"" model---click-wrap and its ""sadistic"" relatives---as accurate signals of individual privacy choices."|Chap 13, Para 42|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1224|13|43|The neoliberal zeitgeist also favored Google's leaders, and later their fellow travelers in the surveillance project, as they sought shelter for their inventions beneath claims of First Amendment rights to freedom of expression. This is a complex and contested arena in which constitutional law and political ideology are thoroughly entangled, and I point out just a few elements here in order to better understand the habitat that nurtured the new surveillance market form.|Chap 13, Para 43|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1225|13|44|"[]The key dynamic here is that First Amendment jurisprudence, especially over the last two decades, has reflected a ""conservative-libertarian"" interpretation of First Amendment rights. As constitutional law scholar Steven Heyman suggests, ""In recent decades, the First Amendment has become one of the most important means by which judges have sought to advance a conservative-libertarian agenda."" This has produced many dramatic judicial decisions, including the US Supreme Court's rejection of any constraints on the role of money in election campaigns, its rejection of restrictions on hate speech and pornography, and its holding that the right to free association takes precedence over state civil rights laws that bar discrimination."|Chap 13, Para 44|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1226|13|45|"As many legal scholars observe, the ideological orientation of contemporary First Amendment judicial reasoning asserts a close connection between free speech and property rights. The logic that links ownership to an absolute entitlement to freedom of expression has led to a privileging of corporate action as ""speech"" deserving of constitutional protection. Some scholars regard this as a dangerous reversion to the feudal doctrines from which corporate law evolved in the seventeenth century. Those medieval legal principles limited the sovereign's authority over ""the corporations of Aristocracy, Church, guilds, universities, and cities... who asserted the right to rule themselves."" One result is that US courts have been ""quick to see the possibilities of governmental overreach, but much less willing to see the problems of 'private,' let alone corporate, power."""|Chap 13, Para 45|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1227|13|46|"In this context, surveillance capitalists vigorously developed a ""cyberlibertarian"" ideology that Frank Pasquale describes as ""free speech fundamentalism."" Their legal teams aggressively assert First Amendment principles to fend off any form of oversight or externally imposed constraints that either limit the content on their platforms or the ""algorithmic orderings of information"" produced by their machine operations. As one attorney who has represented many of the leading surveillance capitalists puts it, ""The lawyers working for these companies have business reasons for supporting free expression. Indeed, all of these companies talk about their businesses in the language of free speech."""|Chap 13, Para 46|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1228|13|47|"This is one respect in which the surveillance capitalists are not unprecedented. Adam Winkler, a historian of corporate rights, reminds us, []""Throughout American history the nation's most powerful corporations have persistently mobilized to use the Constitution to fight off unwanted government regulations."" Although today's mobilizations are not original, Winkler's careful account demonstrates the effects of past mobilizations on the distribution of power and wealth in US society and the strength of democratic values and principles in each era."|Chap 13, Para 47|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1229|13|48|The key point for our story in the age of surveillance capitalism is that the expansion of opportunities for free expression associated with the internet has been an emancipatory force in many vital respects, but this fact must not blind us to another condition: free speech fundamentalism has deflected careful scrutiny of the unprecedented operations that constitute the new market form and account for its spectacular success. The Constitution is exploited to shelter a range of novel practices that are antidemocratic in their aims and consequences and fundamentally destructive of the enduring First Amendment values intended to protect the individual from abusive power.|Chap 13, Para 48|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1230|13|49|"In the US, congressional statutes have played an equally or perhaps even more important role in sheltering surveillance capitalism from scrutiny. The most celebrated of these is a legislative statute known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which shields website owners from lawsuits and state prosecution for user-generated content. ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service,"" the statute reads, ""shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" This is the regulatory framework that enables a site such as TripAdvisor to include negative hotel reviews and permits Twitter's aggressive trolls to roam free without either company being held to the standards of accountability that typically guide news organizations. Section 230 institutionalized the idea that websites are not publishers but rather ""intermediaries."" As one journalist put it, ""To sue an online platform over an obscene blog post would be like suing the New York Public Library for carrying a copy of *Lolita.*"" As we shall see, this reasoning collapses once surveillance capitalism enters the scene."|Chap 13, Para 49|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1231|13|50|"Section 230's hands-off stance toward companies perfectly converged with the reigning ideology and practice of ""self-regulation,"" leaving the internet companies, and eventually the surveillance capitalists among them, free to do what they pleased. The statute was crafted in 1995, during the initial []phase of the public internet. It aimed to clarify intermediaries' liability for the content on their websites and resolve a controversy created by two contradictory court decisions both involving defamatory posts. In 1991 a court found that CompuServe was not liable for defamation because it had not reviewed the contents of a post before it appeared online. The court reasoned that CompuServe was comparable to a public library, bookstore, or newsstand: a distributor, not a publisher."|Chap 13, Para 50|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1232|13|51|"Four years later, in 1995, an early provider of web services called Prodigy was sued for a defamatory anonymous posting on one of its message boards. This time a New York state court came to the opposite conclusion. The key problem as the court saw it was that Prodigy had exercised editorial control by moderating its message boards. The company established content guidelines and deleted posts that violated those standards. The court concluded that Prodigy was a publisher, not merely a distributor, because it had taken responsibility for the content on its site. Were the court's ruling to stand, internet companies would face ""a paradoxical no-win situation: the more an ISP tried to keep obscene or harmful material away from its users, the more it would be liable for that material."" Internet companies faced a binary choice: ""free speech savior or shield for scoundrels?"""|Chap 13, Para 51|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1233|13|52|"According to Senator Ron Wyden, Section 230 was intended to resolve that contradiction by encouraging internet companies to exercise some control over content without the risk of legal sanctions. The very first sentence of the statute mentions ""protection for 'good samaritan' blocking and screening of offensive material."" What Wyden and his colleagues could not have anticipated, and still do not grasp, is that the logic of this early controversy no longer holds. Neither CompuServe nor Prodigy was a surveillance capitalist, but many of today's internet intermediaries are committed to the pursuit of surveillance revenues."|Chap 13, Para 52|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1234|13|53|"This fact fundamentally changes the relationship between the company and the content on its platforms, and it explains why surveillance capitalists cannot be compared to the New York Public Library as the neutral caretaker of Nabokov's venerated book. Far from it. Under the regime of surveillance capitalism, content is a source of behavioral surplus, as is the behavior of the people who provide the content, as are their patterns of connection, communication, and mobility, their thoughts and feelings, and the meta-data []expressed in their emoticons, exclamation points, lists, contractions, and salutations. That book on the bookshelf---along with the records of anyone who may have touched it and when, their location, behavior, networks, and so on---is now the diamond mine ready for excavation and plunder, to be rendered into behavioral data and fed to the machines on their way to product fabrication and sales. Section 230's protection of the ""intermediaries"" now functions as another bulwark that shelters this extractive surveillance capitalist operation from critical examination."|Chap 13, Para 53|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1235|13|54|"There is nothing neutral about the surveillance intermediary now, as the extraction imperative and its demand for economies of scale in surplus supply mean that the surveillance capitalists must use every means to attract a never-ending tide of content to their shores. They no longer merely host content but aggressively, secretly, and unilaterally extract value from that content. As we shall see in [Chapter 18](chapter024.xhtml), economic imperatives require them to forgo as few of these raw materials as possible. That means moderating only those extremes that threaten the volume and velocity of surplus by repelling users or attracting regulatory scrutiny. This is the reason that firms such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter have been reluctant to remove even the most egregious content from their landscapes, and it helps to explain why ""lawyers for tech companies litigate ferociously to prevent even a sliver of erosion"" in Section 230. A statute once crafted to nurture an important new technological milieu is now the legal bulwark that protects the asymmetric wealth, knowledge, and power of a rogue capitalism."|Chap 13, Para 54|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1236|13|55|"In his book *Surveillance After September 11,* surveillance scholar David Lyon writes that in the aftermath of the attacks that day, existing surveillance practices were intensified and previous limits were lifted: ""After several decades in which data-protection officials, privacy watchdogs, civil rights groups, and others have tried to mitigate negative social effects of surveillance, we are witnessing a sharp tilt toward more exclusionary and intrusive surveillance practices."" This abrupt refocusing of governmental power and policy after []the 9/11 attacks in New York City and Washington, DC, is a second historical condition that lent shelter to the fledgling market form."|Chap 13, Para 55|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1237|13|56|"Lyon's characterization is accurate. In the years before 9/11, the Federal Trade Commission emerged as the key actor defining the debate on internet privacy in the US. For reasons that we have already reviewed, the FTC favored self-regulation, and it cajoled internet companies to establish codes of conduct, privacy policies, and methods of enforcement. But the FTC eventually concluded that self-regulation would not be sufficient to protect individual consumers' privacy on the web. In 2000, still one year before the 9/11 attacks, Google's discovery of behavioral surplus, or the success of AdWords, a majority of FTC commissioners issued a report in which they recommended legislation to regulate online privacy: ""Because self-regulatory initiatives to date fall far short of broad-based implementation of self-regulatory programs,"" they wrote, ""the Commission has concluded that such efforts alone cannot ensure that the online marketplace as a whole will follow the standards adopted by industry leaders... notwithstanding several years of industry and governmental effort."" The reported noted that a mere 8 percent of popular websites featured a seal of approval from one of the industry privacy watchdogs."|Chap 13, Para 56|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1238|13|57|"The commissioners proceeded to outline federal legislation that would have protected consumers online despite the dominant bias against regulation and in favor of treating internet operations as free speech. The recommendations demanded ""clear and conspicuous"" notice of information practices; consumer choice over how personal information is used; access to all personal information, including rights to correct or delete; and enhanced security of personal information. Had these been translated into law, it is quite possible that many of the foundational elements of surveillance capitalism would have been either plainly illegal or at least subject to public examination and contest."|Chap 13, Para 57|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1239|13|58|"The FTC effort was short-lived. According to Peter Swire, chief counselor for Privacy in the Clinton Administration and later a member of President Obama's Review Group on Intelligence and Communication Technologies, ""With the attacks of September 11, 2001, everything changed. The new focus was overwhelmingly on security rather than privacy."" The privacy []provisions debated just months earlier vanished from the conversation more or less overnight. In both the US Congress and across the EU, legislation was quickly put in place that decisively expanded surveillance activities. The US Congress passed the Patriot Act, created the Terrorist Screening Program, and instituted a host of other measures that dramatically increased the warrantless collection of personal information. The events of 9/11 also triggered a steady stream of legislation that expanded the powers of intelligence and law-enforcement agencies across Europe, including Germany (a country that had been highly sensitized to surveillance under the hammer of both Nazi and Stalinist totalitarianism), the UK, and France."|Chap 13, Para 58|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1240|13|59|"In the US the failure to ""connect the dots"" on the terrorist attack was a source of shame and dismay that overwhelmed other concerns. Policy guidelines shifted from ""need to know"" to ""need to share"" as agencies were urged to tear down walls and blend databases for comprehensive information and analysis. In a parallel development, privacy scholar Chris Jay Hoofnagle observes that the threat of comprehensive privacy legislation had also mobilized the business community and its lobbyists to either ""shape or stop"" any potential bill. In the post--9/11 political environment, the two forces converged for an easy victory."|Chap 13, Para 59|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1241|13|60|"The internet was the critical target. CIA Director Michael Hayden conceded as much in 2013 when he told an audience that in the years following 9/11, the CIA ""could be fairly charged with the militarization of the world wide web."" Legislation to regulate online privacy was an immediate casualty. Marc Rotenberg, the director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), testified to the 9/11 Commission on the sudden reversal of privacy concerns, observing that before 9/11, ""There was hardly any positive discussion about the development of techniques that would enable massive surveillance while attempting to safeguard privacy."" Swire concurred, noting that as a result of the new emphasis on information sharing, ""Congress lost interest in regulating information usage in the private sector.... Without the threat of legislation, the energy went out of many of the self-regulatory efforts that industry had created."" At the FTC, the focus shifted from the broader concerns of privacy rights to a more politically palatable ""harms-based"" strategy, pursuing cases in which concrete physical harms or economic injuries could be defined, such as identify theft or database security."|Chap 13, Para 60|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1242|13|61|[]With legislation off the table, other forces shaped the political environment in which surveillance capitalism would root and grow. The 9/11 terrorist attacks thrust the intelligence community into an unfamiliar demand curve that insisted on exponential increases in velocity. For all its secrecy, even the NSA was subject to the temporalities and legal restrictions of a democratic state. The tempos of democracy are slow by design, weighted by redundancies, checks and balances, laws and rules. The agencies sought methods of deployment that could rapidly bypass legal and bureaucratic restrictions.|Chap 13, Para 61|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1243|13|62|"In this environment of trauma and anxiety, a ""state of exception"" was invoked to legitimate a new imperative: speed at any cost. As Lyon put it, ""What 9/11 did was to produce socially negative consequences that hitherto were the stuff of repressive regimes and dystopian novels.... The suspension of normal conditions is justified with reference to the 'war on terrorism.'"" Critical to our story is the fact that this state of exception favored Google's growth and the successful elaboration of its surveillance-based logic of accumulation."|Chap 13, Para 62|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1244|13|63|"Google's mission was to ""organize and make accessible the world's information,"" and by late 2001 the intelligence community established ""information dominance"" in the public's house, quickly institutionalizing it in hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of state-sponsored global technology infrastructure, personnel, and practice. The contours of a new interdependency between public and private agents of information dominance began to emerge, one that is best understood through the lens of what the sociologist Max Weber once called an ""elective affinity"" born of a mutual magnetism that originates in shared meanings, interests, and reciprocities."|Chap 13, Para 63|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1245|13|64|The elective affinity between public intelligence agencies and the fledgling surveillance capitalist Google blossomed in the heat of emergency to produce a unique historical deformity: *surveillance exceptionalism.* The 9/11 attacks transformed the government's interest in Google, as practices that just hours earlier were careening toward legislative action were quickly recast as mission-critical necessities. Both institutions craved certainty and were determined to fulfill that craving in their respective domains at any price. These elective affinities sustained surveillance exceptionalism and contributed to the fertile habitat in which the surveillance capitalism mutation would be nurtured to prosperity.|Chap 13, Para 64|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1246|13|65|[]The elective affinity between public and private missions was evident as early as 2002, when former NSA Chief Admiral John Poindexter proposed his Total Information Awareness (TIA) program with a vision that reads like an early guide to the foundational mechanisms of behavioral surplus capture and analysis:|Chap 13, Para 65|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1247|13|66|:::  If terrorist organizations are going to plan and execute attacks against the United States, their people must engage in transactions and they will leave signatures in this information space.... We must be able to pick this signal out of the noise... the relevant information extracted from this data must be made available in large-scale repositories with enhanced semantic content for analysis to accomplish this task. :::|Chap 13, Para 66|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1248|13|67|"As CIA Director George Tenet had declared in 1997, ""The CIA needs to swim in the Valley,"" referring to the need to master the new technologies flowing from Silicon Valley. In 1999 it opened a CIA-funded venture firm in the valley, In-Q-Tel, as a conduit for cutting-edge technologies. The operation was meant to be an agency experiment, but after 9/11 it became a critical source of new capabilities and relationships, including with Google. As Silicon Valley's *Mercury News* reported, ""There's a new urgency with the CIA to find technology that makes sense of all the unstructured data floating around on the internet and elsewhere. The agency can't train analysts quickly enough."" In-Q-Tel's CEO described the government's agencies as ""scrambling"" and noted that ""we're in a state of hyperactivity now."""|Chap 13, Para 67|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1249|13|68|"Surveillance exceptionalism thrived in that hyperactivity. Poindexter's Total Information Awareness program did not obtain congressional support, but an analysis in the *MIT Technology Review* showed that many of the TIA initiatives were quietly reassigned to the Pentagon's Advanced Research and Development Activity (ARDA), which in 2002 received \$64 million to fund a research program in ""novel intelligence from massive data."" In 2004 the US General Accounting Office surveyed 199 data-mining projects across dozens of federal agencies and more than 120 programs developed to collect and analyze personal data to predict individual behavior. The *New York Times* reported in 2006 that the intelligence agencies, backed by a \$40 billion annual []budget, regularly fielded secretive shopping expeditions to Silicon Valley in search of new data-mining and analysis technologies."|Chap 13, Para 68|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1250|13|69|"State security agencies sought ways to avail themselves of Google's rapidly developing capabilities and simultaneously use Google to further develop, commercialize, and diffuse security and surveillance technologies with proven intelligence value. If TIA could not be fully developed and integrated in Washington, parts of the job could be delegated to Silicon Valley and its standout in information dominance: Google. By late summer 2003, Google was awarded a \$2.07 million contract to outfit the agency with Google search technology. According to documents obtained by Consumer Watchdog under the Freedom of Information Act, the NSA paid Google for a ""search appliance capable of searching 15 million documents in twenty-four languages."" Google extended its services for another year at no cost in April 2004."|Chap 13, Para 69|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1251|13|70|"In 2003 Google also began customizing its search engine under special contract with the CIA for its Intelink Management Office, ""overseeing top-secret, secret and sensitive but unclassified intranets for CIA and other IC agencies."" Key agencies used Google systems to support an internal wiki called Intellipedia that allowed agents to share information across organizations as quickly as it was vacuumed up by the new systems. In 2004 Google acquired Keyhole, a satellite mapping company founded by John Hanke, whose key venture backer was the CIA venture firm, In-Q-Tel. Keyhole would become the backbone for Google Earth, and Hanke would go on to lead Google Maps, including the controversial Street View Project. In 2009 Google Ventures and In-Q-Tel both invested in a Boston-based startup, Recorded Future, that monitors every aspect of the web in real time in order to predict future events. *Wired* reported that it was the first time the CIA-backed venture firm and Google had funded the same startup and that both firms had seats on Recorded Future's board of directors."|Chap 13, Para 70|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1252|13|71|"In the decade that followed 9/11, surveillance exceptionalism was also expressed in the flattery of imitation, as the NSA tried to become more like Google, emulating and internalizing Google's capabilities in a variety of domains. In 2006 General Keith Alexander outlined his vision for a search tool called ICREACH that ""would allow unprecedented volumes of... metadata to be shared and analyzed across the many agencies in the Intelligence []Community."" By late 2007, the program was piloted, boosting the number of communications events it shared from 50 billion to more than 850 billion. The system was designed with a ""Google-like"" search interface that enabled analysts to run searches against meta-data ""selectors"" and to extract vital behavioral surplus for analyses that could reveal ""social networks,"" ""patterns of life,"" and ""habits,"" and in general ""predict future behavior."" In 2007 two NSA analysts wrote an internal training manual on how to find information on the internet. It expressed the agency's keen interest in all things Google with a detailed chapter devoted to a deconstruction of Google Search and the Google ""hacks"" that can uncover information not intended for public distribution."|Chap 13, Para 71|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1253|13|72|"That year, the elective affinities that infused the intelligence community's interest in Google were also highlighted when Google research director and AI expert Peter Norvig presented at a Pentagon Highlands Forum meeting: an exclusive networking event where military and intelligence officials commune with members of the high-tech industry, elected officials, elite academics, top corporate executives, and defense contractors. In 2001 the forum's director, Richard O'Neill, described its work to a Harvard audience as ""an idea engine, so the ideas that emerge from meetings are available for use by decision makers as well as by people from the think tanks."" It was to be a bridge between the government and commercial leaders, especially in Silicon Valley. According to one highly detailed account by investigative journalist Nafeez Ahmed and cited by legal scholar Mary Anne Franks, the forum was both a support system and an incubator of Google's growth, as well as a connecting and convening force for the Pentagon, intelligence agencies, and the young company: ""The US intelligence community's incubation of Google from inception occurred through a combination of direct sponsorship and informal networks of financial influence, themselves closely aligned with Pentagon interests."" Another legal scholar described the ""collaboration"" between Google and the intelligence community, especially the NSA, as ""unprecedented."""|Chap 13, Para 72|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1254|13|73|"During these years, scholars noted the growing interdependencies between the intelligence agencies, resentful of constitutional constraints on their prerogatives, and the Silicon Valley firms. The agencies craved the lawlessness that a firm such as Google enjoyed. In his 2008 essay ""The []Constitution in the National Surveillance State,"" law professor Jack Balkin observed that the Constitution inhibits government actors from high-velocity pursuit of their surveillance agenda, and this creates incentives for the government ""to rely on private enterprise to collect and generate information for it."" Balkin noted that the Supreme Court has imposed few privacy restrictions on business records and information that people give to third parties. E-mail is typically held in private servers, making its protection ""limited if not nonexistent."" This absence of law made private companies attractive partners for government actors bound to democratic constraints."|Chap 13, Para 73|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1255|13|74|"The government's need to evade constitutional oversight, argues legal scholar Jon Michaels, leads to secret public-private intelligence collaborations that tend to be ""orchestrated around handshakes rather than legal formalities, such as search warrants, and may be arranged this way to evade oversight and, at times, to defy the law."" He observed that intelligence agencies are irresistibly drawn to ""and in some respects dependent upon"" firms' privately held data resources."|Chap 13, Para 74|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1256|13|75|"Both scholars' observations were confirmed in 2010, when former NSA Director Mike McConnell offered another glimpse into the elective affinities between Google and the intelligence community. Writing in the *Washington Post,* McConnell made clear that Google's surveillance-based operations in data capture, extraction, and analysis were both taken for granted and coveted. Here the boundaries of private and public melt in the intense heat of new threats and their high-velocity demands that must be met in ""milliseconds."" In McConnell's future there is one ""seamless"" surveillance empire in which the requirements of self-preservation leave no opportunity for the amenities of democracy, with its time-wasting practices of due process, evidence, warrants, and law. As McConnell insisted,"|Chap 13, Para 75|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1257|13|76|:::  information can move quickly back and forth from public to private and classified to unclassified... to protect the nation's critical infrastructure. Recent reports of possible partnership between Google and the government point to the kind of joint efforts---and shared challenges---that we are likely to see in the future... such arrangements will muddy the waters between the traditional roles of the borders, and our defensive efforts must be similarly seamless. :::|Chap 13, Para 76|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1258|13|77|"In the final months of the Obama administration, then Secretary of Defense Ash Carter toured Silicon Valley, where he announced a new Defense Innovation Advisory Board, meant to formalize a channel between the tech executives and the DOD. Carter appointed Schmidt to the new board and tasked him with selecting its members. As *Wired* concluded, ""The government needs Silicon Valley more than ever as it seeks to defend from security threats in cyberspace."" These facts are amply illustrated in a comprehensive treatment of ""bulk collection"" by an international group of scholars and edited by Indiana University's Fred Cate and Berkeley's James Dempsey. Cate and Dempsey note the ""expansive aggregation"" of personal data in the hands of private companies: ""Governments understandably want access to this data.... Essentially every government in the world claims the power to compel disclosure of this data by the companies that hold it."" Had it not been for surveillance exceptionalism, it is possible that these data would not even exist, at least not in their current volume and detail."|Chap 13, Para 77|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1259|13|78|"Surveillance exceptionalism helped to shape the evolutionary course of information capitalism by creating an environment in which Google's budding surveillance practices were coveted rather than contested. Once again, history offers us no control groups, and we cannot know with certainty whether information capitalism might have developed in a different direction had it not been for the sudden new interest in surveillance capabilities. For now, it appears that one unanticipated consequence of this public-private ""elective affinity"" was that the fledgling practices of surveillance capitalism were allowed to root and grow with little regulatory or legislative challenge, emboldening Google's young leaders to insist on lawlessness as a natural right and, in ways that are even more opaque, emboldening the state to grant them that freedom."|Chap 13, Para 78|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1260|13|79|Powerful elective affinities favored the acquisition of certainty at any price, and part of that price appears to have been the shelter of surveillance capitalism. In the fullness of time, historians will no doubt discover the specifics of these relationships and the ways in which Google's discoveries in the []capture and use of behavioral surplus were sheltered from scrutiny, at least in part, because of this new habitat of militarized demand.|Chap 13, Para 79|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1261|13|80|In the context of new military purpose, the digital capabilities that were aimed toward the advocacy-oriented values of the behavioral value reinvestment cycle flowed toward surveillance without impediment. Surveillance assets thrived without risk of sanction and attracted surveillance capital. Revenue followed. The situation recalls the auto, steel, and machine tool industries at mid-century, when military orders kept plants operating at full capacity. In the end, however, this turned out to be more curse than blessing. Military demand distorted and suppressed the innovation process and drove a wedge between these industries and their civilian customers, leaving them vulnerable to foreign competitors in the globalizing markets of the late 1970s and early 1980s.|Chap 13, Para 80|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1262|13|81|Similarly, under the conditions of surveillance exceptionalism, Google's leaders were not compelled to undertake the arduous and risky work of inventing an exchange-based advocacy-oriented market form when the surveillance model was so lucrative. Why risk experimentation with more-organic paths to monetization when surveillance and extraction operations were safe from law and hugely profitable? Eventually, it wasn't just Google asking these questions; every other internet business faced the same choices. Once surveillance revenues set the bar for venture capitalists and Wall Street analysts, it became that much easier for internet companies to go with the flow. Then it became onerous not to.|Chap 13, Para 81|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1263|13|82|Why is it that so many years after the events that triggered the mania for information dominance, surveillance capitalism still runs with relatively little impediment, especially in the US? The intervening years have seen the proliferation of thousands of institutional facts that normalized surveillance capitalism's practices and made them appear necessary and inevitable: the discovery of behavioral surplus and the massive accumulations of capital and material that followed, the proliferation of devices and services, the integration of data flows, and the institutionalization of futures markets in human behavior.|Chap 13, Para 82|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1264|13|83|[]This does not mean that we should succumb to the natural fallacy and interpret this flourishing as a signal of surveillance capitalism's inherent worthiness or inevitability. In the coming chapters we will uncover many additional factors that have contributed to this success, but here I want to focus on Google's proactive efforts to build fortifications around its supply chains in order to protect surplus flows from challenge.|Chap 13, Para 83|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1265|13|84|Although many elements of this fortification strategy have been well publicized, their importance for our story lies in the fact that each is one aspect of a multipronged effort that deflects scrutiny from core operations in order to maintain the flow of free, unregulated behavioral surplus. Fortifications have been erected in four key arenas to protect Google, and eventually other surveillance capitalists, from political interference and critique: (1) the demonstration of Google's unique capabilities as a source of competitive advantage in electoral politics; (2) a deliberate blurring of public and private interests through relationships and aggressive lobbying activities; (3) a revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google and the Obama administration, united by elective affinities during Google's crucial growth years of 2009--2016; and (4) Google's intentional campaign of influence over academic work and the larger cultural conversation so vital to policy formation, public opinion, and political perception. The results of these four arenas of defense contribute to an understanding of how surveillance capitalism's facts came to stand and why they continue to thrive.|Chap 13, Para 84|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1266|13|85|"First, Google demonstrated that the same predictive knowledge derived from behavioral surplus that had made the surveillance capitalists wealthy could also help candidates win elections. To make the point, Google was ready to apply its magic to the red-hot core of twenty-first-century campaigning, beginning with the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. Schmidt had a leading role in organizing teams and guiding the implementation of cutting-edge data strategies that would eclipse the traditional political arts with the science of behavioral prediction. Indeed, ""At Obama's Chicago headquarters... they remodeled the electorate in every battleground state each weekend... field staff could see the events' impact on the projected behaviors and beliefs of every voter nationwide."""|Chap 13, Para 85|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1267|13|86|"Research by media scholars Daniel Kreiss and Philip Howard indicates that the 2008 Obama campaign compiled significant data on more than 250 []million Americans, including ""a vast array of online behavioral and relational data collected from use of the campaign's web site and third-party social media sites such as Facebook...."" Journalist Sasha Issenberg, who documented these developments in his book *The Victory Lab,* quotes one of Obama's 2008 political consultants who likened predictive modeling to the tools of a fortune-teller: ""We knew who... people were going to vote for before they decided."""|Chap 13, Para 86|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1268|13|87|"Obama used his proximity to Schmidt to cement his own identity as the innovation candidate poised to disrupt business as usual in Washington. Once elected, Schmidt joined the Transition Economic Advisory Board and appeared next to Obama at his first postelection press conference. According to *Politico,* ""The image alone of Schmidt standing elbow-to-elbow with Obama's top economic thinkers was enough to send shivers up the spine of Google's competitors. 'This terrifies Microsoft,' said a Democratic lobbyist familiar with the industry. 'There's a reason why people are scared to death of Google.'"""|Chap 13, Para 87|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1269|13|88|"Schmidt's role in President Obama's election was but one chapter in a long, and by now fabled, relationship that some have described as a ""love affair."" Not surprisingly, Schmidt took on an even more prominent role in the 2012 reelection campaign. He led in fundraising and in breaking new technical ground, and he ""personally oversaw the voter-turnout system on election night."""|Chap 13, Para 88|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1270|13|89|"Political correspondent Jim Rutenberg's *New York Times* account of the data scientists' seminal role in the 2012 Obama victory offers a vivid picture of the capture and analysis of behavioral surplus as a political methodology. The campaign knew ""every single wavering voter in the country that it needed to persuade to vote for Obama, by name, address, race, sex, and income,"" and it had figured out how to target its television ads to these individuals. One breakthrough was the ""persuasion score"" that identified how easily each undecided voter could be persuaded to vote for the Democratic candidate."|Chap 13, Para 89|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1271|13|90|"The facts of behavioral surplus and its predictive power were kept top secret in the Obama campaigns, just as they are in Google, Facebook, and other domains of information dominance. As Rutenberg observed, ""The extent to which the campaign used the newest tech tools to look into people's lives and []the sheer amount of personal data its vast servers were crunching remained largely shrouded. The secrecy... was partly... to maintain their competitive edge. But it was also no doubt because they worried that practices like 'data mining' and 'analytics' could make voters uncomfortable."""|Chap 13, Para 90|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1272|13|91|"Second, with the 2012 election in sight, an interview with the *Washington Post* in 2011 found Schmidt boasting about another fortification strategy: ""The staffers are young---the staffers get it.... So that's what we depend on. And of course we've hired ex-staffers as well. They all know each other. So that's how it really works."" Google's political utilities paved the way for the unusually crowded and fast-spinning revolving door between the East Coast and West Coast centers of power. The Google Transparency Project analyzed the movement of staff between the Googlesphere (the company plus its affiliates and its law and lobbying firms) and the government (including the White House, Congress, government agencies, federal commissions, and national political campaigns) during the Obama years. It found that by April 2016, 197 individuals had migrated from the government into the Googlesphere, and 61 had moved in the other direction. Among these, 22 White House officials went to work for Google, and 31 Googlesphere executives joined the White House or federal advisory boards with direct relevance to Google's business."|Chap 13, Para 91|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1273|13|92|"Third, just to be on the safe side, Google shared its largesse throughout the political system. In Schmidt's 2014 book, coauthored with longtime Google executive Jonathan Rosenberg, the CEO aggressively developed the theme of government as the shill of incumbents colluding to inhibit change, with Google on the outside: an upstart and a disrupter. The authors voiced their disdain for politicians and lobbyists, writing, ""This is the natural path of politicians since incumbents tend to have a lot more money than disrupters and are quite expert in using it to bend the political will of any democratic government."""|Chap 13, Para 92|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1274|13|93|That same year, while Schmidt disparaged incumbents and their political sway, Google spent more on lobbying than any other corporation---over \$17 million and nearly twice as much as surveillance rival Facebook. In the next few years, as the White House changed hands, Google maintained its pace, outspending every other company with a more than \$18 million lobbying outlay in 2018 as the company fended off privacy legislation and other initiatives that might impede its freedom to capture and process behavioral []surplus. Google was also among the wealthiest of all registered lobbyists in the EU, second only to a lobbying group that represents a confederation of European corporations.|Chap 13, Para 93|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1275|13|94|"The firm also learned to engineer sophisticated lobbying efforts at the state level, primarily geared to fight back any proposed legislation that would augment privacy and curtail behavioral surplus operations. For example, Google won the right to put its self-driving cars on the road---anticipated as important supply chains---after enlisting Obama officials to lobby state regulators for key legislation. Both Google and Facebook currently lead aggressive state-level lobbying campaigns aimed at repelling or weakening statutes to regulate biometric data and protect privacy. As one report put it, ""They want your body."""|Chap 13, Para 94|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1276|13|95|"In the fourth arena of fortifications the corporation learned to infiltrate and influence academic research and civil society advocacy in ways that softened or in some cases thwarted the examination of its practices. The *Washington Post* describes Google as a ""master of Washington influence"" and notes the subtlety with which the firm grasps and directs its own narrative. Schmidt was hands-on in this work as well. Already a board member of the New America Foundation, a public-policy think tank that played an influential role in shaping the Obama administration's approach to economic issues, he assumed the chairmanship in 2013 with a personal donation of \$1 million, a significant percentage of its \$12.9 million annual budget that year. Between 1999 and 2016, when Schmidt left the board, the foundation received \$21 million from a combination of Google, Schmidt, and Schmidt's family foundation."|Chap 13, Para 95|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1277|13|96|"The *Washington Post* published an elaborate exposé of Google's meticulous work in this fourth domain, illustrated in the backstage intrigues that accompanied a three-part series on internet search competition held at George Mason University's Law and Economics Center, a ""free-market--oriented"" academic center that had received significant funding from Google. The meetings occurred in May 2012, just as the FTC was investigating the Google antitrust case. Reporters found that company staffers worked closely with the center, choosing pro-Google speakers and participants, many of whom were Google employees. Their efforts included ""sending the center's staff a detailed spreadsheet listing members of Congress, FTC commissioners, and senior officials with the []Justice Department and state attorney general's office."" Reporters noted that the conference's panels were dominated by ""leading technology and legal experts"" who forcefully rejected the need for government action against Google, ""making their arguments before some of the very regulators who would help determine its fate."" Many participants had no idea that Google was involved in crafting the meetings because Google and center staffers had agreed to conceal the corporation's backstage involvement."|Chap 13, Para 96|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1278|13|97|"The FTC antitrust investigation appears to have heightened Google's fears of a regulatory threat to surveillance capitalism. That year, Google's grant-making operation aimed at civil society organizations took an aggressive turn. According to the Center for Media and Democracy's investigatory research report, ""The Googlization of the Far Right,"" the corporation's 2012 list of grantees featured a new group of antigovernment groups known for their opposition to regulation and taxes and their support for climate-change denial, including Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, the Koch brothers--funded Heritage Action, and other antiregulatory groups such as the Federalist Society and the Cato Institute. The corporation also quietly acknowledged its membership in the corporate lobbying group ALEC, known for its opposition to gun control and emissions curbs, and for its support for voter-suppression schemes, tobacco industry tax breaks, and other far-right causes. Meanwhile, a list of Google Policy Fellows for 2014 included individuals from a range of nonprofit organizations whom one would expect to be leading the fight against that corporation's concentrations of information and power, including the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Future of Privacy Forum, the National Consumers League, the Citizen Lab, and the Asociación por los Derechos Civiles."|Chap 13, Para 97|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1279|13|98|"In July 2017 the *Wall Street Journal* reported that since 2009, Google had actively sought out and provided funding to university professors for research and policy papers that support Google's positions on matters related to law, regulation, competition, patents, and so forth. In many cases, Google weighed in on the papers before publication, and some of the authors did not disclose Google as a source of funding. Although Google publicly claimed that ""the check came with no requirements,"" another case in 2017 belied that notion. That summer, one of the New America Foundation's most []highly regarded scholars and a specialist in digital monopolies, Barry Lynn, posted a statement praising the EU's historic decision to levy a \$2.7 billion fine on Google as the result of a multiyear antitrust investigation. According to the *New York Times* and Lynn's own account, New America's director bent to pressure from Schmidt, firing Lynn and his Open Markets team of ten researchers. ""Google is very aggressive in throwing its money around Washington and Brussels, and then pulling strings,"" Lynn told the *New York* *Times.* ""People are so afraid of Google now."" The reporters cite Google's ""muscular and sophisticated"" influence operation as surpassing any other US company's."|Chap 13, Para 98|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1280|13|99|With Google in the lead, surveillance capitalism vastly expanded the market dynamic as it learned to expropriate human experience and translate it into coveted behavioral predictions. Google and this larger surveillance project have been birthed, sheltered, and nurtured to success by the historical conditions of their era---second-modernity needs, the neoliberal inheritance, and the realpolitik of surveillance exceptionalism---as well as by their own purpose-built fortifications designed to protect supply chain operations from scrutiny through political and cultural capture.|Chap 13, Para 99|13 A UTOPIA OF CERTAINTY
1281|13|100|Surveillance capitalism's ability to keep democracy at bay produced these stark facts. Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organization and presentation of the world's information.

1282|14|5|"There could not have been a more fitting setting for Eric Schmidt to share his opinion on the future of the web than the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In 2015, during a session at the winter playground for neoliberals---and increasingly surveillance capitalists---Schmidt was asked for his thoughts about the future of the internet. Sitting alongside his former Google colleagues Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer, he did not hesitate to share his belief that ""The internet will disappear. There will be so many IP addresses... so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with, that you won't even sense it. It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room and the room is dynamic."" The audience gasped in astonishment, and shortly thereafter, headlines around the world exploded in shock at the former Google CEO's pronouncement that the end of the internet was at hand."|Chap 14, Para 5|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1283|14|6|"Schmidt was, in fact, merely paraphrasing computer scientist Mark Weiser's seminal 1991 article, ""The Computer for the 21st Century,"" which has framed Silicon Valley's technology objectives for nearly three decades. Weiser []introduced what he called ""ubiquitous computing"" with two legendary sentences: ""The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it."" He described a new way of thinking ""that allows the computers themselves to vanish into the background.... Machines that fit the human environment instead of forcing humans to enter theirs will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods."""|Chap 14, Para 6|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1284|14|7|"Weiser understood that the virtual world could never be more than a shadow land no matter how much data it absorbs: ""Virtual reality is only a map, not a territory. It excludes desks, offices, other people... weather, trees, walks, chance encounters and, in general, the infinite richness of the universe."" He wrote that virtual reality ""simulates"" the world rather than ""invisibly enhancing the world that already exists."" In contrast, ubiquitous computing would infuse that *real* world with a universally networked apparatus of silent, ""calm,"" and voracious computing. Weiser refers to this apparatus as the new ""computing environment"" and delights in the possibilities of its limitless knowledge, such as knowing ""the suit you looked at for a long time last week because it knows both of your locations, and it can retroactively find the designer's name even though that information did not interest you at the time."""|Chap 14, Para 7|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1285|14|8|Schmidt was not describing the end of the internet but rather its successful unshackling from dedicated devices such as the personal computer and the smartphone. For surveillance capitalists, this transition is not a choice. Surveillance profits awakened intense competition over the revenues that flow from new markets for future behavior. Even the most sophisticated process of converting behavioral surplus into products that accurately forecast the future is only as good as the raw material available for processing. Surveillance capitalists therefore must ask this: what forms of surplus enable the fabrication of prediction products that most reliably foretell the future? This question marks a critical turning point in the trial-and-error elaboration of surveillance capitalism. It crystallizes a second economic imperative---the *prediction imperative*---and reveals the intense pressure that it exerts on surveillance capitalist revenues.|Chap 14, Para 8|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1286|14|9|"The first wave of prediction products enabled targeted online advertising. These products depended upon surplus derived at scale from the internet. I []have summarized the competitive forces that drive the need for surplus at scale as the ""extraction imperative."" Competition for surveillance revenues eventually reached a point at which the volume of surplus became a necessary but insufficient condition for success. The next threshold was defined by the quality of prediction products. In the race for higher degrees of certainty, it became clear that the best predictions would have to approximate observation. The prediction imperative is the expression of these competitive forces. (See [Figure 3](chapter009.xhtml#fig3) [here](chapter009.xhtml#page-131).)"|Chap 14, Para 9|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1287|14|10|"Google/Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, and many more companies now drawn to surveillance revenues have staked their claims on the internet's ""disappearance"" because they must. Compelled to improve predictions, surveillance capitalists such as Google understood that they had to widen and diversify their extraction architectures to accommodate new sources of surplus and new supply operations. Economies of scale would still be vital, of course, but in this new phase, supply operations were enlarged and intensified to accommodate *economies of scope* and *economies of action.* What does this entail?"|Chap 14, Para 10|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1288|14|11|"The shift toward economies of scope defines a new set of aims: behavioral surplus must be vast, but it must also be varied. These variations are developed along two dimensions. The first is the *extension* of extraction operations from the virtual world into the ""real"" world, where we actually live our actual lives. Surveillance capitalists understood that their future wealth would depend upon new supply routes that extend to real life on the roads, among the trees, throughout the cities. Extension wants your bloodstream and your bed, your breakfast conversation, your commute, your run, your refrigerator, your parking space, your living room."|Chap 14, Para 11|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1289|14|12|Economies of scope also proceed along a second dimension: *depth.* The drive for economies of scope in the depth dimension is even more audacious. The idea here is that highly predictive, and therefore highly lucrative, behavioral surplus would be plumbed from intimate patterns of the self. These supply operations are aimed at your personality, moods, and emotions, your lies and vulnerabilities. Every level of intimacy would have to be automatically captured and flattened into a tidal flow of data points for the factory conveyor belts that proceed toward manufactured certainty.|Chap 14, Para 12|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1290|14|13|[]Just as scale became necessary but insufficient for higher-quality predictions, it was also clear that economies of scope would be necessary but insufficient for the highest quality of prediction products able to sustain competitive advantage in the new markets for future behavior. Behavioral surplus must be vast and varied, but the surest way to predict behavior is to intervene at its source and shape it. The processes invented to achieve this goal are what I call *economies of action.* In order to achieve these economies, machine processes are configured to intervene in the state of play in the real world among real people and things. These interventions are designed to enhance certainty by doing things: they nudge, tune, herd, manipulate, and modify behavior in specific directions by executing actions as subtle as inserting a specific phrase into your Facebook news feed, timing the appearance of a BUY button on your phone, or shutting down your car engine when an insurance payment is late.|Chap 14, Para 13|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1291|14|14|"This new level of competitive intensity characterized by scope and action ratchets up the invasive character of supply operations and initiates a new era of surveillance commerce that I call the *reality business.* Economies of scale were implemented by machine-based extraction architectures in the online world. Now the reality business requires machine-based architectures in the real world. These finally fulfill Weiser's vision of ubiquitous automated computational processes that ""weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it,"" but with a twist. Now they operate in the interests of surveillance capitalists."|Chap 14, Para 14|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1292|14|15|"There are many buzzwords that gloss over these operations and their economic origins: ""ambient computing,"" ""ubiquitous computing,"" and the ""internet of things"" are but a few examples. For now I will refer to this whole complex more generally as the ""apparatus."" Although the labels differ, they share a consistent vision: the everywhere, always-on instrumentation, datafication, connection, communication, and computation of all things, animate and inanimate, and all processes---natural, human, physiological, chemical, machine, administrative, vehicular, financial. Real-world activity is continuously rendered from phones, cars, streets, homes, shops, bodies, trees, buildings, airports, and cities back to the digital realm, where it finds new life as data ready for transformation into predictions, all of it filling the ever-expanding pages of the shadow text."|Chap 14, Para 15|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1293|14|16|[]As the prediction imperative gathers force, it gradually becomes clear that extraction was the first phase of a far-more-ambitious project. Economies of action mean that real-world machine architectures must be able *to know* as well as *to do.* Extraction is not enough; now it must be twinned with execution. The extraction architecture is combined with a new *execution architecture,* through which hidden economic objectives are imposed upon the vast and varied field of behavior.|Chap 14, Para 16|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1294|14|17|"Gradually, as surveillance capitalism's imperatives and the material infrastructures that perform extraction-and-execution operations begin to function as a coherent whole, they produce a twenty-first-century ""means of behavioral modification."" The aim of this undertaking is not to impose behavioral norms, such as conformity or obedience, but rather to produce behavior that reliably, definitively, and certainly leads to desired commercial results. The research director of Gartner, the well-respected business advisory and research firm, makes the point unambiguously when he observes that mastery of the ""internet of things"" will serve as ""a key enabler in the transformation of business models from 'guaranteed levels of performance' to '*guaranteed outcomes.*'"""|Chap 14, Para 17|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1295|14|18|"This is an extraordinary statement because there can be no such guarantees in the absence of the power to make it so. This wider complex that we refer to as the ""means of behavioral modification"" is the expression of this gathering power. The prospect of guaranteed outcomes alerts us to the force of the prediction imperative, which demands that surveillance capitalists make the future for the sake of predicting it. Under this regime, ubiquitous computing is not just a knowing machine; it is an actuating machine designed to produce more certainty *about* us and *for* them."|Chap 14, Para 18|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1296|14|19|This gradually accruing, smart, *and* muscular apparatus is gradually being assembled around us. No one knows what the real magnitude is or will be. It is a domain plagued by hyperbole, where projections frequently outrun actual results. Despite this, the planning, investment, and invention necessary to draw this vision of ubiquity into reality are well underway. The visions and aims of its architects, the work that has already been accomplished, and the programs that are currently in development constitute a turning point in the evolution of surveillance capitalism.|Chap 14, Para 19|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1297|14|20|"[]Finally, I want to underscore that although it may be possible to imagine something like the ""internet of things"" without surveillance capitalism, it is impossible to imagine surveillance capitalism without something like the ""internet of things."" Every command arising from the prediction imperative requires this pervasive real-world material ""knowing and doing"" presence. The new apparatus is the material expression of the prediction imperative, and it represents a new kind of power animated by the economic compulsion toward certainty. Two vectors converge in this fact: the early ideals of ubiquitous computing and the economic imperatives of surveillance capitalism. This convergence signals the metamorphosis of the digital infrastructure *from a thing that we have to a thing that has us.*"|Chap 14, Para 20|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1298|14|21|Futuristic as this may sound, the vision of individuals and groups as so many objects to be continuously tracked, wholly known, and shunted this way or that for some purpose of which they are unaware has a history.

Stuart MacKay, a physicist cum []electrical engineer, biologist, and surgeon who was known among his scientific peers as the experts' expert.|Chap 14, Para 23|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE

He emphasized the key element that distinguished telemetry from other forms of monitoring: the possibility of capturing behavior in its natural habitat with sensors of such compactness that they could disappear into the body without triggering the animal's awareness:|Chap 14, Para 24|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1302|14|25|:::  The use of a radio signal from a transmitter, in or on a subject, to carry information to a remote receiver for recording allows flexibility of movement and permits disturbance-free exploration of otherwise inaccessible parts of the body without the subject even being aware of the measuring process... the methods leave the subject in a relatively normal psychological and physiological state, and do not interfere with the continuation of normal activities. :::|Chap 14, Para 25|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1303|14|26|"MacKay's published work focused primarily on the technical aspects of his studies, although occasionally there is a glimpse of larger purpose. Telemetry created the possibility of huge data sets and the opportunity for correlational studies at the scale of entire animal populations. He noted that the same techniques could be applied to the static world: forest canopies, the curing of concrete, chemical reaction vessels, and food processing. MacKay envisioned whole populations of connected data-emitting individuals. His first-generation ""wearable technologies"" made it possible to study ""unrestrained animals"" among every species, including people. Biomedical telemetry, he stressed, was uniquely suited to gather information that would be otherwise impossible to collect ""in the wild."" The key principle was that his telematics operated outside an animal's awareness. This was especially useful in solving problems such as the difficulty of measuring ""uncooperative animals"" and the need to gather data even when herds roamed through ""inaccessible regions."" In other words, MacKay's inventions enabled scientists to []render animals as information even when they believed themselves to be free, wandering and resting, unaware of the incursion into their once-mysterious landscapes."|Chap 14, Para 26|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1304|14|27|"MacKay stressed that the transmission and monitoring of sensor data were only part of the story. The route was not enough; it had to be the routing. He argued for a ""reverse process"" of telestimulation that would not only monitor behavior but also reveal how it could be modified and optimized, providing what he regarded as ""a remote dialogue between the subject and the experimenter."""|Chap 14, Para 27|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1305|14|28|"MacKay's broad vision has come to fruition in the digital age. Satellite acuity combined with the explosive growth of computational power fitted onto tiny slivers of silicon, advanced sensors, internet-enabled networks, and ""big data"" predictive analytics have produced extraordinary systems that reveal the meanings and movements of whole animal populations and their individuals: anywhere, anytime. The same wearables traveling on and in the bodies of animals have also become broad sensors of the planet's climate, geography, and ecology, enabling ""a quorum sensing of our planet, using a variety of species to tap into the diversity of senses that have evolved across animal groups,"" producing a ""sixth sense of the global animal collective."" As you will already have guessed, there is little reason to suppose that these capabilities will remain trained on nonhuman species."|Chap 14, Para 28|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1306|14|29|"Indeed, the threshold has already been crossed. In 2014 a team of University of Washington researchers led by Jenq-Neng Hwang announced a ""super GPS"" assembled from municipal surveillance cameras ""to enable the dynamic visualization of the realistic situation of humans walking on the road and sidewalks, so eventually people can see the animated version of the real-time dynamics of city streets on a platform like Google Earth."" If this were a novel, then Professor MacKay's brilliant work, along with that of the many dedicated scientists who followed in his footsteps, would serve as foreshadowing."|Chap 14, Para 29|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1307|14|30|"In a metamorphosis that MacKay did not foresee, the science of animal tracking that grew from his pathbreaking vision became the template for surveillance capitalism's next phase of evolution as telematics now applied to human behavior succumbed to the thrall of a new and lucrative logic of accumulation. The requirements of prediction that would later merge into an []economic imperative were already evident in MacKay's work. The need for economies of scope, both in extension and depth, is reflected in his foundational framework that aimed to render information about populations *and* the details of individuals, reaching into the distant corners of previously inaccessible regions. Today those regions include the front seat of your car, your kitchen, and your kidneys. His ""reverse process"" of telestimulation is resurrected in the economies of action that automatically stimulate behavior, not to save the human herd from catastrophe but rather to heighten the predictability of its behavior."|Chap 14, Para 30|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1308|14|31|"MacKay yearned for discovery, but today's ""experimenters"" yearn for certainty as they translate our lives into calculations. MacKay's animals were unrestrained and innately uncooperative because they felt themselves to be free, sheltering and roaming in unknown terrain. Now, the un-self-conscious, easy freedom enjoyed by the human animal---the sense of being unrestrained that thrives in the mystery of distant places and intimate spaces---is simply friction on the path toward surveillance revenues."|Chap 14, Para 31|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1309|14|32|MacKay's legacy is reimagined for our time in the work of Professor Joseph Paradiso of the MIT Media Lab, where some of surveillance capitalism's most valuable capabilities and applications, from data mining to wearable technologies, were invented.|Chap 14, Para 32|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1310|14|33|"Paradiso's brilliant group of data scientists, engineers, musicians, and artists reconceives the world through the lens of Google Search by applying the same disciplines that mastered the web---datafication, indexing, browsing, and searching---to master reality itself. Without ""ubiquitous sensate environments,"" Paradiso writes, ""the cognitive engines of this everywhere-enabled world are deaf, dumb, and blind, and can't respond relevantly to the real-world events that they aim to augment."" In other words, ubiquitous computing is meaningless without the ubiquitous sensing that conveys the experience for computation."|Chap 14, Para 33|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1311|14|34|"To this end, Paradiso's students invented a ""ListenTree,"" which emits streaming sound that ""invites attention"" and ""points to a future where digital []information might become a seamless part of the physical world."" He and his colleagues populated a 250-acre marsh with hundreds of sensors that measure and record temperature, humidity, moisture, light motion, wind, sound, tree sap flow, chemical levels, and more. They developed ""inertial sensors"" that track and compute complex movements and ""flexible sensate fibers"" to create ""radically new functional substrates that can impact medicine, fashion, and apparel... and bring electronics into all things stretchable or malleable."" There are electronics that attach directly to skin in the form of tattoos and makeup, while fingernails and wrists are transformed into computational interfaces that can read finger gestures, even in the absence of hand movements. ""Sensor tape"" and ""stickers"" can adhere ""to inaccessible surfaces and building materials,"" where they can be ""wirelessly interrogated...."""|Chap 14, Para 34|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1312|14|35|"Paradiso and his colleagues wrestled with the paradox of, on the one hand, proliferating sensor data in nearly every environment---from smartphones to home devices to streets to cameras to cars---and, on the other hand, the difficulties involved in integrating sensor-generated data flows and producing meaningful analyses. Their answer was ""DoppelLab,"" a digital platform for combining and visually representing sensor data. The idea is to transform any physical space, from the interior of an office building to an entire city, into a ""browse-able environment"" where you can see and hear everything going on in that space as it flows from thousands or billions or trillions of sensors. Just as browsers like Netscape first ""gave us access to the mass of data contained on the internet, so will software browsers enable us to make sense of the flood of sensor data that is on the way."""|Chap 14, Para 35|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1313|14|36|"The aim here is a grand synthesis: the collation and fusion of every sort of sensor data from every channel and device to develop a ""virtual sensor environment"" in which ""crawlers will constantly traverse data... calculating state and estimating other parameters derived from the data"" collected from everywhere from office interiors to entire cities."|Chap 14, Para 36|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1314|14|37|"Paradiso is confident that ""a proper interface to this artificial sensoria promises to produce... a *digital omniscience*... a pervasive everywhere augmented reality environment... that can be intuitively browsed"" just as web browsers opened up the data contained on the internet. He insists that ubiquitous sensor information and computing will be ""an extension of ourselves rather than an embodiment of an 'other.'"" Information will stream ""directly []into our eyes and ears once we enter the age of wearables... the boundaries of the individual will be very blurry in this future."""|Chap 14, Para 37|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1315|14|38|"According to Paradiso and his coauthor, Gershon Dublon, the next great technological challenge is ""context aggregation,"" which means the ability to assemble rapidly expanding sensor information into new ""applications."" The idea is that every physical space and every trace of behavior within that space---bees buzzing, your smile, the temperature fluctuations in my closet, their breakfast conversation, the swoosh of the trees---will be ""informated"" (translated into information). Spaces can be aggregated into a seamless flow of searchable information, sights, and sounds in much the same way that Google once aggregated web pages for indexing and searching: ""This shift will create a seamless nervous system that covers the planet---and one of the main challenges for the computing community now is how to merge the rapidly evolving 'omniscient' electronic sensoria onto human perception."""|Chap 14, Para 38|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1316|14|39|For all their brilliance, these creative scientists appear to be unaware of the restless economic order eager to commandeer their achievements under the flag of surveillance revenues. Paradiso does not reckon with the translation of his paradise of omniscience into the realpolitik of surveillance capitalism as the prediction imperative insists on surplus culled from these new flows and surveillance capitalists fill the front seats of the classroom of digital omniscience.|Chap 14, Para 39|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1317|14|40|"Waning levels of government leadership and funding for ""ubiquitous computing"" leave the technology companies to lead in basic research and applications, each vying to become ""the Google"" of the new apparatus and its architectures of extraction and execution. Despite the radical prospects of the ubiquitous connected sensate computational apparatus and the often-repeated claim ""It will change everything,"" technology firms in the US have, thus far, continued their run of relative lawlessness, unimpeded by any comprehensive social or regulatory vision. As Intel's chief strategist for the ""internet of things"" commented in response to concerns over privacy implications, ""One thing that we absolutely believe is that though we hear the []conversation around policy, we don't want policy to get in the way of technological innovation...."""|Chap 14, Para 40|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1318|14|41|"In place of ""policy"" or a ""social contract,"" it is capitalism, and increasingly surveillance capitalism, that shapes the action. New behavioral futures markets and ""targeted applications"" are eagerly awaited. As Microsoft's director of the machine intelligence platform for integrating and analyzing data from the ""internet of things"" says, ""The part that's equally cool and creepy is what happens after everybody and their competitor gets on board with smart devices: a big secondary market for data... a secondary revenue source."" These markets, he explains, are ""just like Google or Facebook's"" markets for targeted advertising."" An IBM report concurs: ""Thanks to the internet of things, physical assets are turning into participants in real-time global digital markets. The countless types of assets around us will become as easily indexed, searched and traded as any online commodity.... We call this the 'liquification of the physical world.'"""|Chap 14, Para 41|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1319|14|42|"In an ominous parallel to the rhetoric of ""data exhaust"" as the prelude to dispossession, this second phase of expropriation also requires new rhetoric that can simultaneously legitimate and distract from the real action unleashed by the prediction imperative. A new euphemism, ""dark data,"" plays this role. For example, Harriet Green directed IBM's \$3 billion investment in the ""internet of things,"" a resource commitment that aimed to make the company a serious contender to become ""the Google"" of ubiquitous computing. Green says that digital omniscience is impeded by the fact that most of the data collected by companies are ""unstructured,"" making them difficult to ""datafy"" and code. IBM's customers are plagued by the question ""What can we do with this \[unstructured\] data to make us more efficient or to create new products and services that we can sell to optimize what we're doing or create new things for clients?"""|Chap 14, Para 42|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1320|14|43|"Unstructured data cannot merge and flow in the new circuits of liquefied assets bought and sold. They are friction. Green fixes on the declarative term that simultaneously names the problem and justifies its solution: *dark data.* The message we saw honed in the online world---""If you're not in the system, you don't exist""---is refined for this new phase of dispossession. Because the apparatus of connected things is intended to be *everything,* any behavior of human or thing absent from this push for universal inclusion is *dark:* []menacing, untamed, rebellious, rogue, out of control. The stubborn expanse of dark data is framed as the enemy of IBM's and its customers' ambitions. Note the echoes of MacKay here, with his determination to penetrate the secrets of *unrestrained animals* and *inaccessible regions.* The tension is that no thing counts until it is *rendered* as behavior, translated into electronic data flows, and channeled into the light as observable data. *Everything* must be illuminated for counting and herding."|Chap 14, Para 43|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1321|14|44|"In this way the notion of ""dark data"" handily becomes the ""data exhaust"" of ubiquitous computing. It provides the moral, technical, commercial, and legal rationale for powerful systems of machine intelligence that can capture and analyze behaviors and conditions never intended for a public life. For those who seek surveillance revenues, dark data represent lucrative and necessary territories in the dynamic universal jigsaw constituted by surveillance capitalism's urge toward scale, scope, and action. Thus, the technology community casts dark data as the intolerable ""unknown unknown"" that threatens the financial promise of the ""internet of things."""|Chap 14, Para 44|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1322|14|45|"It is therefore understandable that Green portrays machine intelligence---and specifically IBM's anthropomorphized artificial intelligence system called ""Watson""---as the authoritative savior of an apparatus threatened by waste and incomprehensibility. Machine intelligence is referred to as ""cognitive computing"" at IBM, presumably to avoid the uneasy connotations of inscrutable power associated with words like *machine* and *artificial.*"|Chap 14, Para 45|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1323|14|46|"Under the leadership of CEO Ginni Rometty, the corporation invested heavily in ""Watson,"" heralded by the company as ""the brains of the 'internet of things.'"" Rometty wants IBM to dominate the machine learning functions that will translate ubiquitous data into ubiquitous knowledge and action. ""The first discussion is around how much dark data you have that only Watson and cognitive can really interrogate,"" Green says. ""You know the amount of data being created on a daily basis---much of which will go to waste unless it is utilized. This so-called dark data represents a phenomenal opportunity... the ability to use sensors for everything in the world to basically be a computer, whether it's your contact lens, your hospital bed, or a railway track."" The message is that surveillance capitalism's new instruments will render the entire world's actions and conditions as behavioral flows. Each rendered bit is liberated from its life in the social, no longer inconveniently encumbered by []moral reasoning, politics, social norms, rights, values, relationships, feelings, contexts, and situations. In the flatness of this flow, data are data, and behavior is behavior. The body is simply a set of coordinates in time and space where sensation and action are translated as data. All things animate and inanimate share the same existential status in this blended confection, each reborn as an objective and measurable, indexable, browsable, searchable ""it."""|Chap 14, Para 46|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1324|14|47|From the vantage point of surveillance capitalism and its economic imperatives, world, self, and body are reduced to the permanent status of *objects* as they disappear into the bloodstream of a titanic new conception of markets. His washing machine, her car's accelerator, and your intestinal flora are collapsed into a single dimension of equivalency as information assets that can be disaggregated, reconstituted, indexed, browsed, manipulated, analyzed, reaggregated, predicted, productized, bought, and sold: anywhere, anytime.|Chap 14, Para 47|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1325|14|48|The worldview elaborated by scientists such as Paradiso and business leaders such as Green has been swept into action on many fronts where digital omniscience is eagerly welcomed as the recipe for certainty in of surveillance capitalism: automobile insurance. Extraction and prediction become the hallmarks of a new logic of accumulation as insurers and their consultants plot their approach to surveillance revenues. In the plans and practices of these new actors, we witness both the determination to institutionalize economies of scope and action and the drift toward a dark new world in which the automatic and closely targeted means of behavioral modification are understood as the path to profit.|Chap 14, Para 48|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1326|14|49|"In [Chapter 3](chapter003.xhtml) we met Google's Hal Varian, and now once again he lights the way, exposing the significance and specific requirements of the prediction imperative. Recall that Varian identified four new ""uses"" of the computer mediation of transactions. The first of these was ""data extraction and analysis,"" from which we deduced the extraction imperative as one of the foundational mechanisms of surveillance capitalism. Varian says that the other three new []uses---""new contractual forms due to better monitoring,"" ""personalization and customization,"" and ""continuous experiments""---""will, in time, become even more important than the first."" That time has come."|Chap 14, Para 49|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1327|14|50|"""Because transactions are now computer-mediated we can observe behavior that was previously unobservable and write contracts on it,"" Varian says. ""This enables transactions that were simply not feasible before."" He gravitates to the example of ""vehicular monitoring systems,"" recognizing their paradigmatic power. Varian says that if someone stops making monthly car payments, ""Nowadays it's a lot easier just to instruct the vehicular monitoring system not to allow the car to be started and to signal the location where it can be picked up."" Insurance companies, he notes, can also rely on these monitoring systems to check if customers are driving safely and thus determine whether to maintain the insurance policy, vary the cost of premiums, and decide whether to pay a claim."|Chap 14, Para 50|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1328|14|51|Varian's new uses of computer mediation in this insurance realm are entirely dependent upon internet-enabled devices that know and do. In fact, they are impossible to imagine without the material means of extraction and execution architectures planted in and permeating the real world. The vehicular monitoring system that he prescribes, for example, provides economies of scope *and* action. It knows *and* intervenes in the state of play, monitoring data *and* acting on programmed instructions to shut off the car's engine, thus allowing the repo man to locate the disabled automobile and its vanquished driver.|Chap 14, Para 51|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1329|14|52|"As the prediction imperative pulls supply operations into the real Silicon Valley are enthralled by the prospects of surveillance revenues. For example, the CEO of Allstate Insurance wants to be like Google: ""There are lots of people who are monetizing data today. You get on Google, and it seems like it's free. It's not free. You're giving them information; they sell your information. Could we, should we, sell this information we get from people driving around to various people and capture some additional profit source...? It's a long-term game."" Automobile insurers appear to be especially eager to implement Varian's vision and MacKay's telematics. The fight for your car, it turns out, is an illustration of the intensity of purpose with which companies great and small now pursue behavioral surplus."|Chap 14, Para 52|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1330|14|53|[]Auto insurers have long known that risk is highly correlated with driver behavior and personality, but there was little that they could do about it. Now the remote sensate monitoring systems of modern telematics can provide a continuous stream of data about where we are, where we're going, the details of our driving behavior, and the conditions of our vehicle. App-based telematics can also calculate how we are feeling and what we are saying by integrating dashboard and even smartphone information.|Chap 14, Para 53|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1331|14|54|"Auto insurers are besieged by consultants and would-be technology partners who proffer surveillance capitalistic strategies that promise a new chapter of commercial success. ""Uncertainty will be strongly reduced,"" intones a McKinsey report on the future of the insurance industry. ""This leads to demutualization and a focus on predicting and managing individual risks rather than communities."" A report by Deloitte's Center for Financial Services counsels ""risk minimization""---a euphemism for guaranteed outcomes---through monitoring and enforcing policyholder behavior in real time, an approach called ""behavioral underwriting."" ""Insurers can monitor policyholder behavior directly,"" Deloitte advises, by ""recording the times, locations, and road conditions when they drive, whether they rapidly accelerate or drive at high or even excessive speeds, how hard they brake, as well as how rapidly they make turns and whether they use their turn signals."" Telematics produce continuous data flows, so real-time behavioral surplus can replace the traditional ""proxy factors,"" such as demographic information, that had previously been used to calculate risk. This means that surplus must be both plentiful (economies of scale) and varied (economies of scope) in both range and depth."|Chap 14, Para 54|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1332|14|55|"Even smaller underwriters that cannot afford extensive capital outlays for telematics are advised that they can accomplish most of these aims with a smartphone application, eliminating costly hardware and data-transmission expenses: ""These insurers may also benefit because a mobile app gathers first-hand data on the behavior and performance of the driver carrying the smartphone... yielding a 360-degree view of the total exposure being underwritten...."""|Chap 14, Para 55|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1333|14|56|"As certainty replaces uncertainty, premiums that once reflected the necessary unknowns of everyday life can now rise and fall from millisecond to millisecond, informed by the precise knowledge of how fast you drive to []work after an unexpectedly hectic early morning caring for a sick child or if you perform wheelies in the parking lot behind the supermarket. ""We know that 16-year old drivers have a whole lot of accidents... but not every 16-year old is a lousy driver,"" observes one insurance industry telematics expert. Rates based on actual behavior are ""a big advantage in being able to price appropriately."" This kind of certainty means that insurance contracts designed to mitigate risk now give way to machine processes that respond ""almost immediately"" to nuanced infractions of prescribed behavioral parameters and thus substantially decrease risk or eliminate it entirely."|Chap 14, Para 56|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1334|14|57|"Telematics are not intended merely to know but also to do (economies of action). They are hammers; they are muscular; they enforce. Behavioral underwriting promises to reduce risk through machine processes designed to modify behavior in the direction of maximum profitability. Behavioral surplus is used to trigger punishments, such as real-time rate hikes, financial penalties, curfews, and engine lockdowns, or rewards, such as rate discounts, coupons, and gold stars to redeem for future benefits. The consultancy firm AT Kearney anticipates ""IoT enriched relationships"" to connect ""more holistically"" with customers ""to influence their behaviors."""|Chap 14, Para 57|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1335|14|58|"Varian's blithe statement that ""it's a lot easier"" to instruct a vehicular monitoring system to shut off a car when a payment is late is not hyperbole. For example, Spireon, which describes itself as ""the largest aftermarket vehicle telematics company"" and specializes in tracking and monitoring vehicles and drivers for a variety of customers such as lenders, insurers, and fleet owners, offers a system akin to Varian's ideal. Its ""LoanPlus Collateral Management System"" pushes alerts to drivers when they have fallen behind in their payments, remotely disables the vehicle when delinquency exceeds a predetermined period, and locates the vehicle for the repo man to recover."|Chap 14, Para 58|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1336|14|59|Telematics announce a new day of behavioral control. Now the insurance company can set specific parameters for driving behavior. These can include anything from fastening the seat belt to rate of speed, idling times, braking and cornering, aggressive acceleration, harsh braking, excessive hours on the road, driving out of state, and entering a restricted area. These parameters are translated into algorithms that continuously monitor, evaluate, and rank the driver, calculations that translate into real-time rate adjustments.|Chap 14, Para 59|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1337|14|60|"[]According to a patent held by Spireon's top strategist, insurers can eliminate uncertainty by shaping behavior. The idea is to continuously optimize the insurance rate based on monitoring the driver's adherence to behavioral parameters defined by the insurer. The system translates its behavioral knowledge into power, assigning credits or imposing punishments on drivers. Surplus is also translated into prediction products for sale to advertisers. The system calculates ""behavioral traits"" for advertisers to target, sending ads directly to the driver's phone. A second patent is even more explicit about triggers for punitive measures. It identifies a range of algorithms that activate consequences when the system's parameters are breached: ""a violation algorithm,"" ""a curfew algorithm,"" ""a monitoring algorithm,"" ""an adherence algorithm,"" ""a credit algorithm."""|Chap 14, Para 60|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE

For example, an executive of cloud services provider Covisint advises clients aiming to ""cash in"" on automotive telematics to move beyond targeted ads to ""targeted applications."" These are not ads on a screen but real-life experiences shaped by the same capabilities as targeted ads and designed to lure you into real places for the sake of others' profit.

Health surplus can be ""monetized,"" says Deloitte, by providing ""relevant referrals.""

""It's at that point where a conflict with Google seems preprogrammed."" Google and Amazon are already locked in competition for the dashboard of your car, where their systems will control all communication and applications. From there it is a short step to telemetry and related data. Google already offers applications developers a cloud-based ""scaleable geolocation telemetry system"" using Google Maps. In 2016 Google France announced its interest in partnerships with insurance companies ""to develop bundles of products which blend technology and hardware with insurance.""

1344|14|67|These examples drawn from the ordinary world of automobile insurance teach some extraordinary lessons. Drivers are persuaded, induced, incentivized, or coerced into a quid pro quo that links pricing to the expansion of a real-world extraction/execution architecture aimed at new behavioral surplus flows (economies of scope). Behavioral data drawn from their experience are processed, and the results flow in two directions. First, they return to the drivers, executing procedures to interrupt and shape behavior in order to enhance the certainty, and therefore profitability, of predictions (economies of action). Second, prediction products that rank and sort driver behavior flow into newly convened behavioral futures markets in which third parties lay bets on what drivers will do now, soon, and later: Will he maintain a high safety rating? Will she act in compliance with our rules? Will he drive like a girl? These bets translate into pricing, incentive structures, and monitoring and compliance regimes. In both operations, *surplus drawn from the driver's experience is repurposed as the means to shape and compel the driver's experience for the sake of guaranteed outcomes*. Most of this occurs, as MacKay advised, outside the driver's awareness while she still thinks that she is free.|Chap 14, Para 67|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1345|14|68|"The Google declarations underwrite all the action here. As Varian writes, ""Because transactions are now computer-mediated *we* can observe behavior that was *previously unobservable* and *write* contracts on it. This enables []transactions that were *simply not feasible before.*"" Varian's ""we"" refers to those with privileged access to the shadow text into which behavioral data flow. Our behavior, once unobservable, is declared as free for the taking, theirs to own, and theirs to decide how to use and how to profit from. This includes the production of ""new contractual forms"" that compel us in ways that would not have been possible but for surveillance capitalism's original declarations of dispossession."|Chap 14, Para 68|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1346|14|69|"Varian recognized that the subregions of automotive telematics exemplify this new economic frontier when he wrote, ""Nowadays it's a lot easier just to instruct the vehicular monitoring system not to allow the car to be started and to signal the location where it can be picked up."" Yawn. But wait. ""A lot easier"" for whom? He means, of course, a lot easier for the ""we"" that now observes what was, until surveillance capitalism, unobservable and executes actions that were, until surveillance capitalism, not feasible. Varian's laid-back, simple prose is a kind a lullaby that makes his observations seem banal, so ordinary as to barely warrant comment. But in Varian's scenario, what happens to the driver? What if there is a child in the car? Or a blizzard? Or a train to catch? Or a day-care center drop-off on the way to work? A mother on life support in the hospital still miles away? A son waiting to be picked up at school?"|Chap 14, Para 69|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1347|14|70|"It was not long ago that Varian's prosaic proclamations were regarded as the stuff of nightmares. In his 1967 book *The Year 2000* the hyper-rational wunderkind futurist Herman Kahn anticipated many of the capabilities that Varian now assigns to the new extraction/execution architecture. Kahn was no shrinking violet. He was rumored to be director Stanley Kubrick's model for the title character in *Dr. Strangelove,* and he was well-known for arguing that nuclear war is both ""winnable"" and ""survivable."" Yet it was Kahn who foresaw innovations such as Varian's vehicular monitoring system and characterized them as ""a twenty-first century nightmare."" Among his many technology-oriented insights, Kahn foresaw automated computer systems that track all vehicular movements and also listen to and record conversations with all the capability available for high-speed scan and search. He imagined computer systems able to detect and respond to individual behavior---a raised voice, a threatening tone: ""Such computers may also be able to apply a great deal of inferential logic on their own---they may become a sort of transistorized Sherlock Holmes []making hypotheses and investigating leads in a more or less autonomous or self-motivated manner...."" Anyone who wields this kind of knowledge, he concluded, is, like Faust, ""less immoral than amoral... indifferent to the fate of those who stand in his way rather than brutal."""|Chap 14, Para 70|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1348|14|71|"Contemporary reviewers of Kahn's book invariably seized upon the dark ""nightmare scenarios"" of the computerized surveillance theme, the science-fiction--like forms of control that, they assumed, ""will be actively feared and resented by many."" Despite the wide range of scenarios that Kahn presented in his book on the distant year 2000, Kahn's voyage into the ""unthinkable"" was viewed by the public as a way to prepare for ""the worst possible outcome"" in a terrifying ""nightmare of social controls."" Yet now that same nightmare is rendered as an enthusiastic progress report on surveillance capitalism's latest triumphs. Varian's update is delivered without self-consciousness or a hint of controversy, rather than the astonishment and revulsion that were predicted just decades ago. How has the nightmare become banal? Where is our sense of astonishment and outrage?"|Chap 14, Para 71|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1349|14|72|"Political scientist Langdon Winner grappled with this question in his seminal book *Autonomous Technology,* published in 1977. His answer? ""What we lack is our bearings,"" he wrote. Winner painstakingly described the ways in which our experience of ""things technological"" confounds ""our vision, our expectations, and our capacity to make intelligent judgments. Categories, arguments, conclusions, and choices that would have been entirely obvious in earlier times are obvious no longer."""|Chap 14, Para 72|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1350|14|73|"*So let us establish our bearings.* What Varian celebrates here is not a new form of contract but rather a final solution to the enduring uncertainty that is the raison d'être of ""contract"" as a means of ""private ordering."" In fact, the use of the word *contract* in Varian's formulation is a perfect example of the horseless-carriage syndrome. Varian's invention is unprecedented and cannot be understood as simply another kind of contract. It is, in fact, the *annihilation* of contract; this invention is better understood as the *uncontract.*"|Chap 14, Para 73|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1351|14|74|The uncontract is a feature of the larger complex that is the means of behavioral modification, and it is therefore an essential modality of surveillance capitalism. It contributes to economies of action by leveraging proprietary behavioral surplus to preempt and foreclose action alternatives, thus []replacing the indeterminacy of social processes with the determinism of programmed machine processes. This is not the automation of society, as some might think, but rather the replacement of society with machine action dictated by economic imperatives.|Chap 14, Para 74|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1352|14|75|"The uncontract is not a space of contractual relations but rather a unilateral execution that makes those relations unnecessary. The uncontract desocializes the contract, manufacturing certainty through the substitution of automated procedures for promises, dialogue, shared meaning, problem solving, dispute resolution, and trust: the expressions of solidarity and human agency that have been gradually institutionalized in the notion of ""contract"" over the course of millennia. The uncontract bypasses all that social work in favor of compulsion, and it does so for the sake of more-lucrative prediction products that approximate observation and therefore guarantee outcomes."|Chap 14, Para 75|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1353|14|76|"This substitution of machine work for social work is possible thanks to the success of Google's declarations and the road that Google paved for surveillance capitalists' dominance of the division of learning. Sitting in the catbird seat, Google can observe what was previously unobservable and know what was previously unknowable. As a result, the company can do what was previously undoable: bypass social relations in favor of automated machine processes that compel the behaviors that advance commercial objectives. When we celebrate the uncontract, as Varian and others do, we celebrate the asymmetries of knowledge and power that produce these new possibilities. The uncontract is a signpost that chapter toward a clearer picture of surveillance capitalism's growing ambitions in the annexation of ""reality"" to its kingdom of conquered human experience."|Chap 14, Para 76|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1354|14|77|"It is difficult to keep your bearings when everyone around you is losing theirs. The transition to ubiquitous computing, ""when sensors are everywhere,"" Paradiso writes, won't be ""incremental"" but rather ""a revolutionary phase shift much like the arrival of the world wide web."" The same ""phase shift"" that is []understood by its architects as the universal antidote to uncertainty is anticipated with absolute certainty. Paradiso is not alone here. On the contrary, the rhetoric of inevitability is so ""ubiquitous"" that within the tech community it can be considered a full-blown ideology of *inevitabilism.*"|Chap 14, Para 77|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1355|14|78|"The sense of incontestable certainty that infuses Paradiso's vision has long been recognized as a key feature of utopianism. In their definitive history of utopian thought, Frank and Fritzie Manuel wrote that ""since the end of the eighteenth century the predictive utopia has become a major form of imaginative thought and has preempted certain scientific techniques of forecasting... the contemporary utopia... binds past, present, and future together as though fated.

Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."""|Chap 14, Para 79|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1357|14|80|"Before the rise of the modern utopia, the genre was largely composed of fantastical narratives in which isolated pockets of human perfection were discovered in exotic mountain aeries, hidden valleys, or faraway islands. Modern utopias such as Marxism diverge from those fairy tales, addressing ""the reformation of the entire species"" with a rational systemic vision ""whose province was the whole world."" No longer content as mere weavers of dreams, modern utopianists shifted toward totalistic and universal visions, prophecies of ""the ineluctable end toward which mankind was moving."""|Chap 14, Para 80|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1358|14|81|"Now the proselytizers of ubiquitous computing join Marx and other modern utopianists in postulating a new phase of history, like Paradiso's ""revolutionary phase shift,"" in which all of society is reassembled in a novel and superior pattern. Despite the fact that inevitability is the opposite of politics and history, apostles of the apparatus routinely hijack historical metaphors that lend a veneer of gravitas to their claims. The rise of the apparatus is alternatively cast as the inauguration of a new ""age,"" ""era,"" ""wave,"" ""phase,"" []or ""stage.""

Among high-tech leaders, within the specialist literature, and among expert professionals there appears to be universal agreement on the idea that *everything* will be connected, knowable, and actionable in the near future: ubiquity and its consequences in total information are an article of faith.|Chap 14, Para 82|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE
1360|14|83|"Not surprisingly, Google's leaders are passionate inevitabilists. The very first sentences of Schmidt and Cohen's 2013 book, *The New Digital Age*, exemplify this thrust: ""Soon everyone on Earth will be connected,"" they write. So-called predictive ""laws"" such as ""Moore's Law"" and ""photonics"" are called upon to signal this new iron law of necessity that will produce exponential growth in connectivity and computational power. And later, ""The collective benefit of sharing human knowledge and creativity grows at an exponential rate. In the future, information technology will be everywhere, like electricity. It will be a given."" When the book's assertions garnered some criticism, the authors confronted their critics in an afterword to the paperback edition: ""But bemoaning the inevitable from the real question....

1361|14|84|"Despite its pervasiveness both in Silicon Valley and in the wider culture of data scientists and technology developers, inevitabilism is rarely discussed or critically evaluated. Paradiso's conception of a ""digital omniscience"" is taken for granted, with little discussion of politics, power, markets, or governments. As in most accounts of the apparatus, questions of individual autonomy, moral reasoning, social norms and values, privacy, decision rights, politics, and law take the form of afterthoughts and genuflections that can be solved with the correct protocols or addressed with still more technology solutions. If information will stream ""directly into our eyes and ears"" and ""the boundaries of the individual will be very blurry,"" then who can access that information? What if I don't want my life streaming through your senses? *Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?* The answers to such questions are drowned in the thrum of all things continuously illuminated, registered, counted, controlled, and judged."|Chap 14, Para 84|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE

Paradiso imagines a society in which it falls to each individual to protect herself from the omniscient ubiquitous sensate computational systems of the new apparatus.

The agreement among their responses was striking. Although they did not have the language of surveillance capitalism, nearly every interviewee regarded inevitability rhetoric as a Trojan horse for powerful economic imperatives, and each one of them lamented the lack of any critical discussion of these assumptions."|Chap 14, Para 86|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE

We have seen that surveillance capitalism was discovered and honed in history, handcrafted by men and women to serve the interests of impatient capital. It is this same logic that now demands ubiquity, ready to colonize technical developments for the sake of its imperatives and growth. Inevitabilism operates in the service of these imperatives as it distracts attention from the ambitions of a rising economic order and the competitive anxieties that drive the surveillance project toward certainty, thus necessitating its ever-more-voracious claims on our behavior.|Chap 14, Para 97|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE

As an alternative, Doctoroff suggests ""performance-based zoning"" administered by the ubiquitous apparatus through the medium of algorithms. These processes, like Varian's vehicular monitoring systems, are indifferent to why you behave as long as they can monitor and control the behavior you produce. As Doctoroff explains it, ""I don't care what you put here as long as you don't exceed performance standards like noise levels...."" This is preferable, he says, because it enhances ""the free flow of property... that is a logical extension of... these technologies."" Why should citizens have any say over their communities and the long-term implications of how luxury high-rises, hotels, or a residential building going commercial could affect rents and local businesses as long as an algorithm is satisfied with noise thresholds?"|Chap 14, Para 104|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE

Sidewalk's data flows combine public and private assets for sale in dynamic, real-time virtual markets that extract maximum fees from citizens and leave municipal governments dependent upon Sidewalk's proprietary information. For example, public and private parking spaces are []combined in online markets and rented ""on demand"" as the cost of parking varies in real time, substantially increasing parking income. Optimized parking enforcement depends on Sidewalk's algorithms ""to calculate the most lucrative routes for parking cops,"" earning cities millions of extra dollars that they desperately need but that arrive at the expense of their citizens."|Chap 14, Para 105|14 THE INSTRUMENTARIAN COLLECTIVE

The Flow Transit system integrates information and payment for nearly every kind of transport into Google Maps, and cities are obligated to ""upgrade"" to Sidewalk's mobile payment system ""for all existing transit and parking services."" Just as it requires public-transit data, Sidewalk also insists that cities share all parking and ridership information with Sidewalk Labs in real time.

I closed my eyes and saw the late-afternoon sun slicing through the velvety air by the bedroom fireplace with its ancient sloping mantle where our treasures were on display: a photo of my father and me, heads tilted toward each other, blending our two shocks of curly black hair; the miniature painted enamel boxes, discovered in a Parisian flea market years before the thought of motherhood, which later became the shelter for our children's milk teeth huddled like secret caches of seed pearls. It was impossible to explain the quality of this sadness and longing: how our selves and the life of our family had evolved symbiotically with those spaces that we called home. How our []attachments transformed a house into a hallowed place of love, meaning, and commemoration.|Chap 15, Para 2|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1393|15|3|My difficulty began to ease only when I discovered the work of Gaston Bachelard, an extraordinary man who had been a postal worker, physicist, philosopher, and ultimately a professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne:|Chap 15, Para 3|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1394|15|4|:::  The old house, for those who know how to listen, is a sort of geometry of echoes. The voices of the past do not sound the same in the big room as in the little bed chamber.... Among the most difficult memories, well beyond any geometry that can be drawn, we must recapture the quality of the light; then come the sweet smells that linger in the empty rooms....  :::|Chap 15, Para 4|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1395|15|5|"One of Bachelard's works in particular, *The Poetics of Space,* is instructive as we reckon with the prospects of life in the no-exit shadow of Big Other and its power brokers behind the curtain. In this book Bachelard elaborates his notion of ""topoanalysis,"" the study of how our deepest relationships to inner self and outer world are formed in our experience of space, specifically the space we call ""home"":"|Chap 15, Para 5|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1396|15|6|":::  The house shelters daydreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace.... The house is one of the greatest powers of integration for the thoughts, memories, and dreams of mankind.... It is body and soul. It is the human being's first world. Before he is ""cast into the world,""... man is laid in the cradle of the house.... Life begins well, it begins enclosed, protected, all warm in the bosom of the house....  :::"|Chap 15, Para 6|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1397|15|7|"Home is our school of intimacy, where we first learn to be human. Its corners and nooks conceal the sweetness of solitude; its rooms frame our experience of relationship. Its shelter, stability, and security work to concentrate our unique inner sense of self, an identity that imbues our day dreams and night dreams forever. Its hiding places---closets, chests, drawers, locks, and keys---satisfy our need for mystery and independence. Doors---locked, closed, half shut, wide open---trigger our sense of wonder, safety, possibility, and adventure. []Bachelard plumbs not only the imagery of the human house but also of nests and shells, the ""primal images"" of home that convey the absolute ""primitiveness"" of the need for a safe refuge: ""Well-being takes us back to the primitiveness of the refuge. Physically, the creature endowed with a sense of refuge huddles up to itself, takes to cover, hides away, lies snug, concealed... a human being likes to 'withdraw into his corner'... it gives him physical pleasure to do so."""|Chap 15, Para 7|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1398|15|8|"The shelter of home is our original way of living in space, Bachelard discovers, shaping not only the existential counterpoint of ""home"" and ""away"" but also many of our most fundamental ways of making sense of experience: house and universe, refuge and world, inside and outside, concrete and abstract, being and nonbeing, this and that, here and elsewhere, narrow and vast, depth and immensity, private and public, intimate and distant, self and other."|Chap 15, Para 8|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1399|15|9|Our family instinctively pursued these themes in imagining a new home. When we were finally able to undertake that project, we foraged for durable natural materials: old stone and scarred wooden beams that had weathered the storms of time. We were drawn to old furniture that had already lived many lives composing others' homes. This is how the walls of the new house came to be massive, nearly a foot deep and packed with insulation. The result is just as we had hoped: a lush and peaceful stillness. We know that nothing guarantees safety and certainty in this world, but we are comforted by the serenity of this home and its layered silences.|Chap 15, Para 9|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1400|15|10|The days unfurl now within the embrace of these generous walls, where once again our spirits spread and root. This is how a house becomes a home and a home becomes a sanctuary. I feel this most acutely when I crawl into bed at night. I wait to hear my husband's breathing in syncopation with the muffled sighs of our beloved dog on the floor beside us as she sprints through her ecstatic dreams. I sense beyond to the dense envelope of our bedroom walls and listen to their lullaby of seclusion.|Chap 15, Para 10|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1401|15|11|"According to Big Other's architects, these walls must come down. There can be no refuge. The primal yen for nests and shells is kicked aside like so much detritus from a fusty human time. With Big Other, the universe takes up residence in our walls, no longer the sentinels of sanctuary. Now they are simply the coordinates for ""smart"" thermostats, security cameras, speakers, []and light switches that extract and render our experience in order to actuate our behavior."|Chap 15, Para 11|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1402|15|12|That our walls are dense and deep is of no importance now because the boundaries that define the very experience of home are to be erased. There can be no corners in which to curl up and taste the pleasures of solitary inwardness. There can be no secret hiding places because there can be no secrets. Big Other swallows refuge whole, along with the categories of understanding that originate in its elemental oppositions: house and universe, depth and immensity. Those ageless polarities in which we discover and elaborate our sense of self are casually eviscerated as immensity installs itself in my refrigerator, the world chatters in my toothbrush, elsewhere stands watch over my bloodstream, and the garden breeze stirs the chimes draped from the willow tree only to be broadcast across the planet. The locks? They have vanished. The doors? They are open.|Chap 15, Para 12|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1403|15|13|"In the march of institutional interests intent on implementing Big Other, the very first citadel to fall is the most ancient: the principle of sanctuary. The sanctuary privilege has stood as an antidote to power since the beginning of the human story. Even in ancient societies where tyranny prevailed, the right of sanctuary stood as a fail-safe. There was an exit from totalizing power, and that exit was the entrance to a sanctuary in the form of a city, a community, or a temple. By the time of the Greeks, sanctuaries were sacred sites built across the ancient Greek world and consecrated to the purposes of asylum and religious sacrifice. The Greek word *asylon* means ""unplunderable"" and founds the notion of a sanctuary as an inviolable space. The right of asylum survived into the eighteenth century in many parts of Europe, attached to holy sites, churches, and monasteries. The demise of the sanctuary privilege was not a repudiation but rather a reflection of social evolution and the firm establishment of the rule of law. One historian summarized this transformation: ""justice as sanctuary."""|Chap 15, Para 13|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1404|15|14|"In the modern era the sacredness, inviolability, and reverence that once attached to the law of asylum reemerged in constitutional protections and declarations of inalienable rights. English common law retained the idea of the castle as an inviolable fortress and translated that to the broader notion of ""home,"" a sanctuary free from arbitrary intrusion: unplunderable. The long thread of the sanctuary privilege reappeared in US jurisprudence. Writing []in 1995, legal scholar Linda McClain argued that the equation of home with sanctuary has depended less on the sanctity of property rights than on a commitment to the ""privacies of life."" As she observed, ""There is a strong theme of a proper realm of inaccessibility or secrecy with respect to the world at large as well as a recognition of the important social dimension of such protected inner space...."""|Chap 15, Para 14|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1405|15|15|"The same themes appear from the perspective of psychology. Those who would eviscerate sanctuary are keen to take the offensive, putting us off guard with the guilt-inducing question ""What have you got to hide?"" But as we have seen, the crucial developmental challenges of the self-other balance cannot be negotiated adequately without the sanctity of ""disconnected"" time and space for the ripening of inward awareness and the possibility of reflexivity: reflection on and by oneself. The real psychological truth is this: *If you've got nothing to hide, you are nothing.*"|Chap 15, Para 15|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1406|15|16|"One empirical study makes the point. In ""Psychological Functions of Privacy,"" Darhl Pedersen defines privacy as a ""boundary control process"" that invokes the decision rights associated with ""restricting and seeking interaction."" Pedersen's research identifies six categories of privacy behaviors: solitude, isolation, anonymity, reserve, intimacy with friends, and intimacy with family. His study shows that these varied behaviors accomplish a rich array of complex psychological ""privacy functions"" considered salient for psychological health and developmental success: contemplation, autonomy, rejuvenation, confiding, freedom, creativity, recovery, catharsis, and concealment. These are experiences without which we can neither flourish nor usefully contribute to our families, communities, and society."|Chap 15, Para 16|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1407|15|17|"As the digital era intensifies and surveillance capitalism spreads, the centuries-old solution of ""justice as sanctuary"" no longer holds. Big Other outruns society and law in a self-authorized destruction of the right to sanctuary as it overwhelms considerations of justice with its tactical mastery of shock and awe. The facts of surveillance capitalism's dominance of the division of learning, the unrepentant momentum of its dispossession cycle, the institutionalization of its means of behavior modification, the convergence of these with the requirements of social participation, and the manufacture of prediction products for trade in behavioral futures markets are de facto evidence of a new condition that has not been tamed by law. The remainder []of this chapter explores the implications of this failure. What will taming require? What kind of life is left to us if taming fails?"|Chap 15, Para 17|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1408|15|18|"If sanctuary is to be preserved, synthetic declarations are required: alternative pathways that lead to a human future. It's the wall, not the tunnels, that requires our attention. So far US privacy laws have failed to keep pace with the march of instrumentarianism. Analyses of the ""invasion of privacy,"" according to legal scholar Anita Allen, fall into ""a handful of easily illustrated categories."" Allen contrasts ""physical privacy"" (sometimes called ""spatial privacy"") with ""informational privacy."" She observes that physical privacy is violated ""when a person's efforts to seclude or conceal himself or herself are frustrated."" Information privacy is disturbed ""when data, facts, or conversations that a person wishes to secret or anonymize are nonetheless acquired or disclosed."""|Chap 15, Para 18|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1409|15|19|In the era of Big Other, though, these categories bend and break. Physical places, including our homes, are increasingly saturated with informational violations as our lives are rendered as behavior and expropriated as surplus. In some cases we inflict this on ourselves, typically because we do not grasp the backstage operations and their full implications. Other violations are simply imposed upon us, as in the case of the talking doll, the listening TV, the hundreds of apps programmed for secret rendition, and so on. We have surveyed many of the objects and processes already earmarked to be smart, sensate, actuating, connected, and internet-enabled by surveillance capital. By the time you read these pages, there will be more, and more after that. It's the sorcerer's apprentice cursed with the perpetual filling and refilling driven by an unbounded claim that asserts its right to everything.|Chap 15, Para 19|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1410|15|20|"When US scholars and jurists assess the ways in which digital capabilities challenge existing law, the focus is on Fourth Amendment doctrine as it circumscribes the relationship *between individuals and the state*. It is of course vital that Fourth Amendment protections catch up to the twenty-first century by protecting us from search and seizure of our information in ways that reflect contemporary realities of data production. The problem is that []even expanded protections from the state do not shield us from the assault on sanctuary wrought by instrumentarian power and animated by surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives. The Fourth Amendment as currently construed does not help us here. There is no sorcerer in sight ready to command the surveillance capitalists, in Goethe's words, ""Corner broom! Hear your doom."""|Chap 15, Para 20|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1411|15|21|"Legal scholarship is just beginning to reckon with these facts. As a 2016 article on the ""internet of things"" by Fourth Amendment scholar Andrew Guthrie Ferguson concludes, ""If billions of sensors filled with personal data fall outside of Fourth Amendment protections, a large-scale surveillance network will exist without constitutional limits."" As we have seen, it already does. Dutch scholars make a similar case for the inadequacy of Dutch law as it falls behind Big Other, no longer able to effectively assert the sanctity of the home from the invasive action of either industry or the state: ""The walls no longer shield the individual effectively from the outside in the pursuing of... personal life without intrusion...."""|Chap 15, Para 21|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1412|15|22|"Many hopes today are pinned on the new body of EU regulation known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became enforceable in May 2018. The EU approach fundamentally differs from that of the US in that companies must justify their data activities within the GDPR's regulatory framework. The regulations introduce several key new substantive and procedural features, including a requirement to notify people when personal data is breached, a high threshold for the definition of ""consent"" that puts limits on a company's reliance on this tactic to approve personal data use, a prohibition on making personal information public by default, a requirement to use privacy by design when building systems, a right to erasure of data, and expanded protections against decision making authored by automated systems that imposes ""consequential"" effects on a person's life. The new regulatory framework also imposes substantial fines for violations, which will rise to a possible 4 percent of a company's global revenue, and it allows for class-action lawsuits in which users can combine to assert their rights to privacy and data protection."|Chap 15, Para 22|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1413|15|23|These are vital and necessary accomplishments, and the question that is most important to our story is whether this new regulatory regime can be a springboard to challenging the legitimacy of surveillance capitalism and []ultimately vanquishing its instrumentarian power. In time, the world will learn if the GDPR can move out in front of Big Other, reasserting a division of learning aligned with the values and aspirations of a democratic society. Such a victory would depend upon society's rejection of markets based on the dispossession of human experience as a means to the prediction and control of human behavior for others' profit.|Chap 15, Para 23|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1414|15|24|Scholars and specialists debate the implications of the sweeping new regulations, some arguing the inevitability of decisive change and others arguing the likelihood of continuity over dramatic reversals of practice. There are some things that we do know, however. Individuals each wrestling with the myriad complexities of their own data protection will be no match for surveillance capitalism's staggering asymmetries of knowledge and power. If the past two decades have taught us anything, it is that the individual alone cannot bear the burden of this fight at the new frontier of power.|Chap 15, Para 24|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1415|15|25|This theme is illustrated in the odyssey of Belgian mathematician and data protection activist Paul-Olivier Dehaye, who in December 2016 initiated a request for his personal data collected through Facebook's Custom Audiences and tracking Pixel tools, which would reveal the web pages where Facebook had tracked him. Dehaye probably knew more about the rogue data operations of Cambridge Analytica than anyone in the world, outside of its own staff and masterminds. His aim was a bottom-up investigative approach to uncover the secrets of its illegitimate means of political behavior modification.|Chap 15, Para 25|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1416|15|26|"A first step was to determine what Facebook knew about him, especially the kind of data that would become relevant in an electoral context and thus make him, and others, vulnerable to the kinds of hidden maneuvers that Cambridge Analytica had employed. Dehaye wanted to understand how a citizen might come to ascertain the data that enabled, judging from the worldwide outrage over the revelations of secret online political manipulation, what many people consider a highly ""consequential"" threat. He carefully documented the twists and turns of his journey, hoping that his experience would be useful for journalists, citizens, and communities determined to understand the scope and political vulnerabilities of Facebook's practices. Dehaye writes:"|Chap 15, Para 26|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1417|15|27|":::  It is of course extremely difficult to talk to a company like Facebook as an individual, so by April 2017 I had to escalate the matter to the []Irish Data Protection Commissioner. By October 2017, after a lot of prodding, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner finally agreed to take the first step with my complaint, and ask Facebook for a comment. By December 2017, they had apparently received a response, but as of March 2018 they are still ""assessing"" it, despite frequent reminders. It is very hard not to see a problem here with respect to enforcement. :::"|Chap 15, Para 27|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1418|15|28|"In March 2018, fifteen months after his initial request, Dehaye finally received an e-mail from Facebook's Privacy Operations Team. He was told that the information he sought ""is not available through our self-service tools"" but is stored in ""Hive,"" Facebook's ""log storage area,"" where it is retained for ""data analytics"" and maintained as separate from ""the data bases that power the Facebook site."" The company insisted that accessing the data required it to surmount ""huge technical challenges."" ""This data,"" the company writes, ""*is also not used to directly serve the live Facebook website which users experience.*"""|Chap 15, Para 28|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1419|15|29|"In our language, the information that Dehaye sought required access to the ""shadow text,"" specifically asking for, among other things, details on the targeting analyses that determined the ads he was shown on Facebook. The corporation's response indicates that Hive's data are part of this exclusive ""second text,"" in which behavioral surplus is queued up for manufacture into predictions products. This process is completely separate from the ""first text,"" ""which users experience."""|Chap 15, Para 29|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1420|15|30|Facebook makes clear that the shadow text is not available to users, despite the promotion of its self-service download tools that promise to give users access to their personal data retained by the company. Indeed, the competitive dynamics of surveillance capitalism make the shadow text a crucial proprietary source of advantage. Any attempt to breach its content will be experienced as an existential threat; no surveillance capitalist will *voluntarily* provide data from the shadow text. Only law can compel this challenge to the pathological division of learning.|Chap 15, Para 30|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1421|15|31|"In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March 2018, Facebook announced it would expand the range of personal data that it allows users to download, but even these data remain wholly contained within the first text, []composed largely of the information that users themselves have provided, including information that they have deleted: friends, photos, video, ads that have been clicked, pokes, posts, location, and so on. These data do not include behavioral surplus, prediction products, and the fate of those predictions as they are used for behavioral modification, bought, and sold. When you download your ""personal information,"" you access the stage, not the backstage: the curtain, not the wizard."|Chap 15, Para 31|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1422|15|32|"Facebook's response to Dehaye illustrates another consequence of the extreme asymmetries of knowledge at play. The company insisted that access to the requested data required it to surmount ""huge technical challenges."" As behavioral surplus flows converge in machine-learning--based manufacturing operations, the sheer volume of data inputs and methods of analysis moves beyond human comprehension. Consider something as trivial as the case of Instagram's machines selecting what images to show you. Its computations are based on varied streams of behavioral surplus from a subject user, then more streams from the friends in that user's network, then more from the activities of people who follow the same accounts as the subject user, then the data and social links from the user's Facebook activity. When it finally applies a ranking logic to predict what images the user will want to see next, that analysis also includes data on the past behavior of the subject user. Instagram has machines doing this ""learning"" because humans cannot. In the case of more ""consequential"" analyses, the operations are likely to be equally or even more complex."|Chap 15, Para 32|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1423|15|33|"This recalls our discussion of Facebook's ""prediction engine"" FBLearner Flow, where the machines are fed tens of thousands of data points derived from behavioral surplus, diminishing the very notion of the right to contest ""automatic decision making."" If the algorithms are to be contestable in any meaningful way, it will require new countervailing authority and power, including machine resources and expertise to reach into the core disciplines of machine intelligence and construct new approaches that are available for inspection, debate, and combat. Indeed, one expert has already proposed the creation of a government agency---an ""FDA for algorithms""---to oversee the development, distribution, sale, and use of complex algorithms, arguing that existing laws ""will prove no match for the difficult regulatory puzzles algorithms pose."""|Chap 15, Para 33|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1424|15|34|[]Dehaye's experience is but one illustration of the self-sustaining nature of a pathological division of learning and the insuperable burden placed on individuals moved to challenge its injustice. Dehaye is an activist, and his aim is not only to access data but also to document the arduousness and even absurdity of the undertaking. Given these realities, he suggests that the data-protection regulations are comparable to freedom-of-information laws. The procedures for requesting and receiving information under these laws are imperfect and onerous, typically undertaken by legal specialists, but nevertheless essential to democratic freedom. Although effective contest will require determined individuals, the individual alone cannot shoulder the burden of justice, any more than an individual worker in the first years of the twentieth century could bear the burden of fighting for fair wages and working conditions. Those twentieth-century challenges required collective action, and so do our own.|Chap 15, Para 34|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1425|15|35|"In her discussion of ""the life of the law,"" anthropologist Laura Nader reminds us that law projects ""possibilities of democratic empowerment"" but that these are pulled forward into real life only when citizens actively contest injustice, using the law as a means to higher purpose. ""The life of the law is the plaintiff,"" Nader writes, a truth we saw brought to life in the action of the Spanish citizens who claimed the right to be forgotten. ""By contesting their injustices by means of law, plaintiffs and their lawyers can still decide the place of law in making history."" These plaintiffs do not stand alone; they stand for citizens bonded together as the necessary means of confronting collective injustice."|Chap 15, Para 35|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1426|15|36|"This brings us back to the GDPR and the question of its impact. The only possible answer is that everything will depend upon how European societies interpret the new regulatory regime in legislation and in the courts. It will not be the wording of the regulations but rather the popular movements on the ground that shape these interpretations. A century ago, workers organized for collective action and ultimately tipped the scales of power, and today's ""users"" will have to mobilize in new ways that reflect our own unique twenty-first-century ""conditions of existence."" We need synthetic declarations that are institutionalized in new centers of democratic power, expertise, and contest that challenge today's asymmetries of knowledge and power. This quality of collective action will be required if we are finally to replace lawlessness with laws that assert the right to sanctuary and the right to the future tense as essential for effective human life."|Chap 15, Para 36|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1427|15|37|"[]It is already possible to see a new awakening to empowering collective action, at least in the privacy domain. One example is None of Your Business (NOYB), a nonprofit organization led by privacy activist Max Schrems. After many years of legal contest, Schrems made history in 2015 when his challenge to Facebook's data-collection and data-retention practices---which he asserted were in violation of EU privacy law---led the Court of Justice of the European Union to invalidate the Safe Harbor agreement that governed data transfers between the US and the EU. In 2018 Schrems launched NOYB as a vehicle for ""professional privacy enforcement."" The idea is to push regulators to close the gap between written regulations and corporate privacy practices, leveraging the threat of significant fines to change a company's actual procedures. NOYB wants to become ""a stable European enforcement platform"" that unites groups of users and assists them through the litigation process while building coalitions and advancing ""targeted and strategic litigation to maximize the impact 'on the right to privacy.'"" However this undertaking progresses, the key point for us is the way in which it points to a social void that must be filled with creative new forms of collective action, if the life of the law is to move against surveillance capitalism."|Chap 15, Para 37|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1428|15|38|"Only time will tell if the GDPR will be a catalyst for a new phase of combat that wrangles and tames an illegitimate marketplace in behavioral futures, the data operations that feed it, and the instrumentarian society toward which they aim. In the absence of new synthetic declarations, we may be disappointed by the intransigence of the status quo. If the past is a prologue, then privacy, data protection, and antitrust laws will not be enough to interrupt surveillance capitalism. The reasons that we examined in answering the question ""How did they get away with it?"" suggest that the immense and intricate structures of surveillance capitalism and its imperatives will require a more direct challenge."|Chap 15, Para 38|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1429|15|39|This is at least one conclusion from the past decade: despite far more stringent privacy and data-protection laws in the EU as compared to the US, as well as a forceful commitment to antitrust, Facebook and Google have continued to flourish in Europe. For example, between 2010 and 2017 the compounded annual growth rate for Facebook daily active users was 15 percent in Europe compared to 9 percent in the US and Canada. During that period the company's revenue grew by a compounded annual growth rate of []50 percent in both regions. Between 2009 and the first quarter of 2018, Google's share of the search market in Europe declined by about 2 percent while increasing in the US by about 9 percent. (Google's European market share remained high, at 91.5 percent in 2018, compared to 88 percent in the US.) In the case of its Android mobile phones, however, Google's market share increased by 69 percent in Europe compared to 44 percent in the US. Google's Chrome browser increased its market share by 55 percent in Europe and 51 percent in the US.|Chap 15, Para 39|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1430|15|40|"Those growth rates are not mere good fortune, as our list of ""how they got away with it"" suggests. In recognition of this fact, Europe's Data Protection Supervisor Giovanni Buttarelli told the *New York Times* that the GDPR's impact will be determined by regulators who ""will be up against well-funded teams of lobbyists and lawyers."" Indeed, corporate lawyers were already honing their strategies for the preservation of business as usual and setting the stage for the contests ahead. For example, a white paper published by one prominent international law firm rallies corporations to the barricades of data processing, arguing that the legal concept of ""legitimate interest"" offers a promising opportunity to bypass new regulatory obstacles:"|Chap 15, Para 40|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1431|15|41|:::  Legitimate interest may be the most accountable ground for processing in many contexts, as it requires an assessment and balancing of the risks and benefits of processing for organisations, individuals and society. The legitimate interests of the controller or a third party may also include other rights and freedoms. The balancing test will sometimes also include... freedom of expression, right to engage in economic activity, right to ensure protection of IP rights, etc. These rights must also be taken into account when balancing them against the individuals' right to privacy. :::|Chap 15, Para 41|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1432|15|42|"Surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives were already on the move in late April 2018, in anticipation of the GDPR taking effect that May. Earlier in April, Facebook's CEO had announced that the corporation would apply the GDPR ""in spirit"" across the globe. In practice, however, the company was making changes to ensure that the GDPR would not circumscribe the majority of its operations. Until then, 1.5 billion of its users, including those in []Africa, Asia, Australia, and Latin America, were governed by terms of service issued by the company's international headquarters in Ireland, meaning that these terms fell under the EU framework. It was in late April that Facebook quietly issued new terms of service, placing those 1.5 billion users under US privacy laws and thus eliminating their ability to file claims in Irish courts."|Chap 15, Para 42|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE

We do this to satisfy our enduring need for sanctuary and as an act of resistance with which to reject the instrumentarian disciplines of the hive, its ""extended chilling effects,"" and Big Other's relentless greed. In the context of government surveillance, the practices of ""hiding"" have been called ""privacy protests"" and are well-known for drawing the suspicion of law-enforcement agencies. Now, hiding is also invoked by Big Other and its market masters, whose reach is far and deep as they install themselves in our walls, our bodies, and on our streets, claiming our faces, our feelings, and our fears of exclusion."|Chap 15, Para 46|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1437|15|47|"I have suggested that too many of the best and brightest of a new generation devote their genius to the intensification of the click-stream. Equally more poignant is the way in which a new generation of activists, artists, and inventors feels itself called to create the art and science of hiding. The intolerable conditions of glass life compel these young artists to dedicate their genius to the prospects of human invisibility, even as their creations demand that we aggressively seek and find our bearings. Their provocations already take many forms: signal-blocking phone cases, false fingerprint prosthetics that prevent your fingertips from being ""used as a key to your life,"" LED privacy visors to impede facial-recognition cameras, a quilted coat that blocks radio waves and tracking devices, a scent diffuser that releases a metallic fragrance when an unprotected website or network is detected on any of your devices, a ""serendipitor app"" to disrupt any surveillance ""that relies on subjects maintaining predictable routines,"" a clothing line called ""Glamouflage"" featuring shirts covered with representations of celebrity faces to confuse facial-recognition software, anti-neuroimaging surveillance headgear to obstruct digital invasion of brain waves, and an anti-surveillance coat that creates a shield to block invasive signals. Chicago artist Leo Selvaggio produces []3-D--printed resin prosthetic masks to confound facial recognition. He calls his effort ""an organized artistic intervention."""|Chap 15, Para 47|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1438|15|48|"Perhaps most poignant is the Backslash Tool Kit: ""a series of functional devices designed for protests and riots of the future,"" including a smart bandana for embedding hidden messages and public keys, independently networked wearable devices, personal black-box devices to register abuse of law enforcement, and fast deployment routers for off-grid communication. Backslash was created as part of a master's thesis project at New York University, and it perfectly reflects the contest for the third modernity that this generation faces. The designer writes that for young, digitally native protesters, ""*connectivity is a basic human right.*"" Yet, he laments, ""the future of technology in protests looks dark"" because of overwhelming surveillance. His tool kit is intended to create ""a space to explore and research the tense relationship between protests and technology and a space to cultivate dialogue about freedom of expression, riots and disruptive technology."" In a related development, students at the University of Washington have developed a prototype for ""on-body transmissions with commodity devices."" The idea here is that readily available devices ""can be used to transmit information to only wireless receivers that are in contact with the body,"" thus creating the basis for secure and private communications independent of normal Wi-Fi transmissions, which can easily be detected."|Chap 15, Para 48|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1439|15|49|"Take a casual stroll through the shop at the New Museum for Contemporary Art in Manhattan, and you pass a display of its bestseller: table-top mirrors whose reflecting surface is covered with the bright-orange message ""Today's Selfie Is Tomorrow's Biometric Profile."" This ""Think Privacy Selfie Mirror"" is a project of the young Berlin-based artist Adam Harvey, whose work is aimed at the problem of surveillance and foiling the power of those who surveil. Harvey's art begins with ""reverse engineering... computer vision algorithms"" in order to detect and exploit their vulnerabilities through camouflage and other forms of hiding. He is perhaps best known for his ""Stealth Wear,"" a series of wearable fashion pieces intended to overwhelm, confuse, and evade drone surveillance and, more broadly, facial-recognition software. Silver-plated fabrics reflect thermal radiation, ""enabling the wearer to avert overhead thermal surveillance."" Harvey's fashions are inspired by traditional Islamic dress, which expresses the idea that ""garments can provide a separation between []man and God."" Now he redirects that meaning to create garments that separate human experience from the powers that surveil. Another Harvey project created an aesthetic of makeup and hairstyling---blue feathers suspended from thick black bangs, dreadlocks that dangle below the nose, cheekbones covered in thick wedges of black and white paint, tresses that snake around the face and neck like octopus tentacles---all designed to thwart facial-recognition software and other forms of computer vision."|Chap 15, Para 49|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1440|15|50|"Harvey is one among a growing number of artists, often *young* artists, who direct their work to the themes of surveillance and resistance. Artist Benjamin Grosser's Facebook and Twitter ""demetricators"" are software interfaces that present each site's pages with their metrics deleted: ""The numbers of 'likes,' 'friends,' followers, retweets... all disappear."" How is an interface that foregrounds our friend count changing our conceptions of friendship? he asks. ""Remove the numbers and find out."" Grosser's ""Go Rando"" project is a web browser extension that ""obfuscates your feelings on Facebook"" by randomly choosing an emoji each time you click ""Like,"" thus undermining the corporation's surplus analyses as they compute personality and emotional profiles. Trevor Paglen's richly orchestrated performance art combines music, photography, satellite imagery, and artificial intelligence to reveal Big Other's omnipresent knowing and doing. ""It's trying to look inside the software that is running an AI... to look into the architectures of different computer vision systems and trying to learn what it is that they are seeing,"" Paglen says. Chinese artist Ai Weiwei's 2017 installation ""Hansel & Gretel"" created a powerful experience in which participants viscerally confront the surveillance implications of their own innocent picture taking, Instagramming, tweeting, texting, tagging, and posting."|Chap 15, Para 50|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1441|15|51|Our artists, like our young people, are canaries in the coal mine. That the need to make ourselves invisible is the theme of a brilliant artistic vanguard is another kind of message in a bottle cast from the front lines of mourning and revulsion. Glass life is intolerable, but so is fitting our faces with masks and draping our bodies in digitally resistant fabrics to thwart the ubiquitous lawless machines. Like every counter-declaration, hiding risks becomes an adaptation when it should be a rallying point for outrage. *These conditions are unacceptable. Tunnels under this wall are not enough. This wall must come down.*|Chap 15, Para 51|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1442|15|52|[]The greatest danger is that we come to feel at home in glass life or in the prospect of hiding from it. Both alternatives rob us of the life-sustaining inwardness, born in sanctuary, that finally distinguishes us from the machines. This is the well from which we draw the capacities to promise and to love, without which both the private bonds of intimacy and the public bonds of society wither and die. If we do not alter this course now, we leave a monumental work for the generations that follow us. Industrial capitalism commandeered nature only to saddle the coming generations with the burden of a burning planet. Will we add to this burden with surveillance capitalism's invasion and conquest of human nature? Will we stand by as it subtly imposes the life of the hive while demanding the forfeit of sanctuary and the right to the future tense for the sake of its wealth and power?|Chap 15, Para 52|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1443|15|53|"Paradiso calls it a revolution, and Pentland says it is the death of individuality. Nadella and Schmidt advocate the machine hive as our role model, with its coercive confluence and preemptive harmonies. Page and Zuckerberg understand the transformation of society as a means to their commercial ends. There are dissenters among us, to be sure, but the declaration of life without walls has thus far failed to trigger a mass withdrawal of agreement. This is in part the result of our dependency and in part because we do not yet appreciate the breadth and depth of what the architects have in store, let alone the consequences that this ""revolution"" might entail."|Chap 15, Para 53|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1444|15|54|Our sensibilities grow numb to the monstrosity of Big Other as its features are developed, tested, elaborated, and normalized. We become deaf to the lullaby of walls. Hiding from the machines and their masters drifts from the obsessions of the vanguard to a normal theme of social discourse and eventually our conversations around the dinner table. Each step down this path occurs as if in the fog of war: scattered fragments and incidents that appear abruptly and often in obscurity. There is little room to perceive the pattern, let alone its origins and meaning. Nonetheless, each deletion of the possibility of sanctuary leaves a void that is seamlessly and soundlessly filled by the new conditions of instrumentarian power. ::: :::  [][CHAPTER EIGHTEEN](toc.xhtml#toc-chapter024) |Chap 15, Para 54|15 OF LIFE IN THE HIVE
1445|16|5|I wake early. The day begins before I open my eyes. My mind is in motion. Words and sentences have streamed through my dreams, solving problems on yesterday's pages. The first work of the day is to retrieve those words that lay open a puzzle. Only then am I ready to awaken my senses. I try to discern each birdcall in the symphony outside our windows: the phoebe, redwing, blue jay, mockingbird, woodpecker, finch, starling, and chickadee. Soaring above all their songs are the cries of geese over the lake. I splash warm water on my face, drink cool water to coax my body into alertness, and commune with our dog in the still-silent house. I make coffee and bring it into my study, where I settle into my desk chair, call up my screen, and begin. I think. I write these words, and I imagine you reading them. I do this every day of every week---as I have for several years---and it is likely that I will continue to do so for one or two years to come.|Chap 16, Para 5|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1446|16|6|I watch the seasons from the windows above my desk: first green, then red and gold, then white, and then back to green again. When friends come []to visit, they peek into my study. There are books and papers stacked on every surface and most of the floor. I know they feel overwhelmed at this sight, and sometimes I sense that they silently pity me for my obligation to this work and how it circumscribes my days. I do not think that they realize how free I am. In fact, I have never felt more free. How is this possible?|Chap 16, Para 6|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1447|16|7|I made a promise to complete this work. This promise is my flag planted in the future tense. It represents my commitment to construct a future that cannot come into being should I abandon my promise. This future will not exist without my capacity first to imagine its facts and then to will them into being. I am an inchworm moving with determination and purpose across the distance between now and later. Each tiny increment of territory that I traverse is annexed to the known world, as my effort transforms uncertainty into fact. Should I renege on my promise, the world would not collapse. My publisher would survive the abrogation of our contract. You would find many other books to read. I would move on to other projects.|Chap 16, Para 7|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1448|16|8|My promise, though, is an anchor that girds me against the vagaries of my moods and temptations. It is the product of my will to will and a compass that steers my course toward a desired future that is not yet real. Events may originate in energy sources outside my will and abruptly alter my course in ways that I can neither predict nor control. Indeed, they have already done so. Despite this certain knowledge of uncertainty, I have no doubt that I am free. I can promise to create a future, and I can keep my promise. If the book that I have imagined is to exist in the future, it must be because I will to will it so. I live in an expansive landscape that already includes a future that only I can imagine and intend. In my world, this book I write already exists. In fulfilling my promise, I make it manifest. *This act of will is my claim to the future tense.*|Chap 16, Para 8|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1449|16|9|"To make a promise is to predict the future; to fulfill a promise through the exercise of will turns that prediction into fact. Our hearts pump our blood, our kidneys filter that blood, and our wills create the future in the patient discovery of each new sentence or step. This is how we claim our right to speak in the first person as the author of our futures. The philosopher Hannah Arendt devoted an entire volume to an examination of will as the ""organ for the future"" in the same way that memory is our mental organ for the past. The power of will lies in its unique ability to deal with things, ""visibles and invisibles, that have never existed at all. Just as the past always presents itself to the mind in []the guise of certainty, the future's main characteristic is its basic uncertainty, no matter how high a degree of probability prediction may attain."" When we refer to the past, we see only objects, but the view to the future brings ""projects,"" things that are yet to be. With freedom of will we undertake action that is entirely contingent on our determination to see our project through. These are acts that we could have ""left undone"" but for our commitment. ""A will that is not free,"" Arendt concludes, ""is a contradiction in terms."""|Chap 16, Para 9|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1450|16|10|"Will is the organ with which we summon our futures into existence. Arendt's metaphor of will as the ""mental organ of our future"" suggests that it is something built into us: organic, intrinsic, inalienable. Moral philosophers have called this ""free will"" because it is the human counterpoint to the fear of uncertainty that suffocates original action. Arendt describes promises as ""islands of predictability"" and ""guideposts of reliability"" in an ""ocean of uncertainty."" They are, she argues, the only alternative to a different kind of ""mastery"" that relies on ""domination of one's self and rule over others."""|Chap 16, Para 10|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1451|16|11|Centuries of debate have been levied on the notion of free will, but too often their effect has been to silence our own declarations of will, as if we are embarrassed to assert this most fundamental human fact. I recognize my direct experience of freedom as an inviolate truth that cannot be reduced to the behaviorists' formulations of life as necessarily accidental and random, shaped by external stimuli beyond my knowledge or influence and haunted by irrational and untrustworthy mental processes that I can neither discern nor avoid.|Chap 16, Para 11|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1452|16|12|"The American philosopher John Searle, whose work on the ""declaration"" we discussed in [Chapter 6](chapter011.xhtml), comes to a similar conclusion in his examination of ""free will."" He points to the ""causal gap"" between the reasons for our actions and their enactment. We may have good reasons to do something, he observes, but that does not necessarily mean it will be done. ""The traditional name of this gap in philosophy is 'the freedom of the will.'"" In response to the ""sordid history"" of this concept, he reasons, ""even if the gap is an illusion it is one we cannot shake off.... The notion of making and keeping promises presupposes the gap.... \[It\] requires consciousness and a sense of freedom on the part of the promise-making and promise-keeping agent."""|Chap 16, Para 12|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1453|16|13|"The freedom of will is the existential bone structure that carries the moral flesh of every promise, and my insistence on its integrity is not an indulgence in nostalgia or a random privileging of the pre-digital human story as []somehow more truly human. This is the only kind of freedom that we can guarantee ourselves, no matter the weight of entropy or inertia, and irrespective of the forces and fears that attempt to collapse time into an eternity of shadowboxing now, and now, and now. These bones are the necessary condition for the possibility of civilization as a ""moral milieu"" that favors the dignity of the individual and respects the distinctly human capacities for dialogue and problem solving. Any person, idea, or practice that breaks these bones and tears this flesh robs us of a self-authored and we-authored future."|Chap 16, Para 13|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1454|16|14|These principles are not quaint accessories, as Hal Varian and others suggest. Rather, they are hard-won achievements that have crystallized over millennia of human contest and sacrifice. Our freedom flourishes only as we steadily will ourselves to close the gap between making promises and keeping them. Implicit in this action is an assertion that through my will I can influence the future. It does not imply total authority over the future, of course, only over my piece of it. *In this way, the assertion of freedom of will also asserts the right to the future tense as a condition of a fully human life.*|Chap 16, Para 14|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1455|16|15|"Why should an experience as elemental as this claim on the future tense be cast as a human right? The short answer is that it is only necessary now because it is imperiled. Searle argues that such elemental ""features of human life"" rights are crystallized as formal human rights only at that moment in history when they come under systematic threat. So, for example, the ability to speak is elemental. The concept of ""freedom of speech"" as a formal right emerged only when society evolved to a degree of political complexity that the freedom to speak came under threat. The philosopher observes that speech is not more elemental to human life than breathing or being able to move one's body. No one has declared a ""right to breathe"" or a ""right to bodily movement"" because these elemental rights have not come under attack and therefore do not require formal protection. What counts as a basic right, Searle argues, is both ""historically contingent"" and ""pragmatic."""|Chap 16, Para 15|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1456|16|16|I suggest that we now face the moment in history when the elemental *right to the future tense* is endangered by a panvasive digital architecture of behavior modification owned and operated by surveillance capital, necessitated by its economic imperatives, and driven by its laws of motion, all for the sake of its guaranteed outcomes.|Chap 16, Para 16|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1457|16|17|"Most simply put, there is no freedom without uncertainty; it is the medium in which human will is expressed in promises. Of course, we do not only make promises to ourselves; we also make promises to one another. When we join our wills and our promises, we create the possibility of collective action toward a shared future, linked in determination to make our vision real in the world. This is the origin of the institution we call ""contract,"" beginning with the ancient Romans."|Chap 16, Para 17|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1458|16|18|"Contracts originated as shared ""islands of predictability"" intended to mitigate uncertainty for the human community, and they still retain this meaning. ""The simplest way to state the point of contract law is that it supports and shapes the social practice of making and keeping promises and agreements,"" concludes one eminent scholar. ""Contract law focuses on problems of cooperation,"" summarizes another. ""Contract law... reflects a moral ideal of equal respect for persons. This fact explains why contract law can produce genuine legal obligations and is not just a system of coercion,"" observes a third."|Chap 16, Para 18|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1459|16|19|"It is in this context that the destructiveness of the uncontract is most clearly revealed. Recall Varian's assertion that if someone stops making monthly car payments, ""Nowadays it's a lot easier just to instruct the vehicular monitoring system not to allow the car to be started and to signal the location where it can be picked up."" Varian calls this new capability a ""new contract form,"" when in reality the uncontract abandons the human world of legally binding promises and substitutes instead the positivist calculations of automated machine processes. Without so much as a tip of the cap and a ""fare-thee-well,"" Varian's uncontract disposes of several millennia of societal evolution during which Western civilization institutionalized the contract as a grand achievement of shared will."|Chap 16, Para 19|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1460|16|20|"It is no secret that the institution of the contract has been twisted and abused in every age, from the *Requirimiento* to the ""slave contract,"" as incumbent power imposes painful inequalities that drain the meaning, and indeed the very possibility, of mutual promising. For example, Max Weber warned that the great achievements of contractual freedom create []opportunities to exploit property ownership as a means to ""the achievement of power over others."""|Chap 16, Para 20|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1461|16|21|"However, today's uncontracts are unprecedented in their ability to impose unilateral power. They leverage the apparatus to combine pervasive monitoring and remote actuation for an internet-enabled ""new economics"" that bypasses human promises and social engagement. The uncontract aims instead for a condition that the economist Oliver Williamson describes as ""contract utopia"": a state of perfect information known to perfectly rational people who always perform exactly as promised. The problem is, as Williamson writes, ""*All complex contracts are unavoidably incomplete*... parties will be confronted with the need to adapt to unanticipated disturbances that arise by reason of gaps, errors and omissions in the original contract."""|Chap 16, Para 21|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1462|16|22|If you have ever seen a house built according to architectural plans, then you have a good idea of what Williamson means. There is no blueprint that sufficiently details everything needed to convert drawings and specifications into an actual house. No plan anticipates every problem that might arise, and most do not come close. The builders' skills are a function of how they collaborate to invent the actions that fulfill the intention of the drawings as they solve the unexpected but inevitable complications that arise along the way. They work together to construct a reality from the uncertainty of the plan.|Chap 16, Para 22|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1463|16|23|Like builders, people in contractual agreements undertake this kind of collaboration. It's not simply finding the way through a maze to an already agreed-upon end point, but rather the continuous refinement and clarification of ends and means in the face of unanticipated obstacles. This sociality of contract may entail conflict, frustration, oppression, or anger, but it can also produce trust, cooperation, cohesion, and adaptation as the means through which human beings confront an unknowable future.|Chap 16, Para 23|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1464|16|24|"Were ""contract utopia"" to exist, Williamson says, it would best be described as a ""plan"" that, like other ""utopian modes,"" requires ""deep commitment to collective purposes"" and ""personal subordination."" Subordination to what? To the plan. Contract in this context of perfect rationality is what Williamson describes as ""a world of planning."" Such planning was the basic institution of socialist economics, where the ""new man"" was idealized as possessing ""a high level of cognitive competence"" and therefore, it was espoused, could design highly effective plans. Varian deftly swaps out socialism's ""new []man"" and installs instead a market defined by surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives, expressed through a ubiquitous computational architecture, the machine intelligence capabilities to which data are continuously supplied, the analytics that discern patterns, and the algorithms that convert them into rules. This is the essence of the uncontract, which transforms the human, legal, and economic risks of contracts into plans constructed, monitored, and maintained by private firms for the sake of guaranteed outcomes: less contract utopia than *uncontract dystopia.*"|Chap 16, Para 24|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1465|16|25|In November 2016 the experience of three people in the small Illinois town of Belleville was testimony to what we lose when we subordinate ourselves to the dystopian rule of the uncontract. Pat and Stanford Kipping owed their credit union \$350 on their 1998 Buick. Once again, they could not make their monthly \$95 payment. The Kippings' credit union enlisted a local repo man, Jim Ford, to take away their car.|Chap 16, Para 25|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1466|16|26|When Ford visited the Kippings' Belleville home, he was disturbed to find an elderly couple who were forced to choose between buying medicine and making their car payments. Ford's initial response was to waive his repossession fees. The Kippings generously thanked him, invited him in for tea, and shared their story. That's when Ford decided to bridge the gap between uncertain reality and the stipulations of their contract. He did the human thing, calling the credit union and offering to pay the couple's debt.|Chap 16, Para 26|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1467|16|27|"The credit union manager insisted that Ford had to follow the ""process."" Ford continued to invoke the ancient social principles of the contract, seeking a way through the maze to something that felt like justice. Ultimately the manager agreed to ""work with"" the couple to see what could be done. It didn't end there. Within twenty-four hours, an online fund-raising appeal produced enough to pay off the Kippings' car, detail it, purchase a Thanksgiving turkey, and give the couple an additional gift of \$1,000."|Chap 16, Para 27|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1468|16|28|"Most interesting is that when a local paper picked up the story, it quickly went viral across the web and traditional media. Millions of people read and responded to this drama, presumably because it stirred memories of something precious and necessary but now threatened with extinction. Jim Ford reminded us of the most cherished requirements of a civilized life: our shared assertion of rights to the future tense and its expression in the joining of wills in mutual commitment to dialogue, problem solving, and empathy. He was eloquent on []this point: ""Just be nice to people. It's not that hard. The fact that this has gone so crazy is kind of sad. This should be a daily thing, a normal thing."""|Chap 16, Para 28|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1469|16|29|In the dystopia of the uncontract, this daily human thing is not normal. What if the Kippings' credit union employed Spireon's telematics and merely had to instruct the vehicular monitoring system to disable the car? There would be no loan manager engaging in a give-and-take with customers. The algorithm tasked to eliminate the messy, unpredictable, untrustworthy eruptions of human will would have seized the old Buick. There would have been no shared tea time with the Kippings and no one to listen to their story. There would have been no opportunity to find an alternate route through the maze, no opportunity to build trust, no occasion for collective action, no heartwarming holiday story of kindness, no glimmer of hope for a human future in which the best of our institutions is preserved and fortified, no shared challenge of uncertainty, and no shared freedom.|Chap 16, Para 29|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1470|16|30|In the dystopia of the uncontract, surveillance capitalism's drive toward certainty fills the space once occupied by all the human work of building and replenishing social trust, which is now reinterpreted as unnecessary friction in the march toward guaranteed outcomes. The deletion of uncertainty is celebrated as a victory over human nature: our cunning and our opportunism. All that's left to matter are the rules that translate reasons into action, the objective measures of behavior, and the degree of conformance between the two. Social trust eventually withers, a kind of vestigial oddity like a third nipple or wisdom teeth: traces of an evolutionary past that no longer appear in operational form because their context and therefore their purpose have vanished.|Chap 16, Para 30|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1471|16|31|The uncontract and the for-profit circuits of behavior modification in which it executes its objectives construe society as an acrid wasteland in which mistrust is taken for granted. By positing our lives together as already failed, it justifies coercive intervention for the sake of certainty. Against this background of the gradual normalization of the automated plan and its planners, the human response of one repo man bears simple witness to precisely what surveillance capitalism must extinguish.|Chap 16, Para 31|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1472|16|32|Human replenishment from the failures and triumphs of choosing the future in the face of uncertainty gives way to the blankness of perpetual compliance. The word *trust* lingers, but its referent in human experience dissolves into reminiscence, an archaic footnote to a barely remembered dream of a []dream that has long since faded for the sake of a new dictatorship of market reasons. As the dream dies, so too does our sense of astonishment and protest. We grow numb, and our numbness paves the way for more compliance. A pathological division of learning forged by unprecedented asymmetries of knowledge and power fixes us in a new inequality marked by the tuners and the tuned, the herders and herded, the raw material and its miners, the experimenters and their unwitting subjects, those who will the future and those who are shunted toward others' guaranteed outcomes.|Chap 16, Para 32|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1473|16|33|So let us establish our bearings. Uncertainty is not chaos but rather the necessary habitat of the present tense. We choose the fallibility of shared promises and problem solving over the certain tyranny imposed by a dominant power or plan because this is the price we pay for the freedom to will, which founds our right to the future tense. In the absence of this freedom, the future collapses into an infinite present of mere behavior, in which there can be no subjects and no projects: only *objects.*|Chap 16, Para 33|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1474|16|34|In the future that the surveillance capitalism prepares for us, my will and yours threaten the flow of surveillance revenues. Its aim is not to destroy us but simply to author us and to profit from that authorship. Such means have been imagined in the past, but only now are they feasible. Such means have been rejected in the past, but only now have they been allowed to root. We are ensnared without awareness, shorn of meaningful alternatives for withdrawal, resistance, or protection.|Chap 16, Para 34|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1475|16|35|The promise of the promise and the will to will run deeper than these deformities. They remind us of that place again where we humans heal the breach between the known and the unknowable, navigating the seas of uncertainty in our vessels of shared promises. In the real world of human endeavor, there is no perfect information and no perfect rationality. Life inclines us to take action and to make commitments even when the future is unknown. Anyone who has brought a child into the world or has otherwise given his or her heart in love knows this to be true.|Chap 16, Para 35|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1476|16|36|Gods know the future, but we move forward, take risks, and bind ourselves to others despite the fact that we can't know everything about the present, let alone the future. This is the essence of our freedom, expressed as the elemental right to the future tense. With the construction and ownership of the new means of behavioral modification, the fate of this right conforms to a pattern that we []already have identified. It is not extinguished, but rather it is usurped: commandeered and accumulated by surveillance capital's exclusive claims on our futures.|Chap 16, Para 36|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1477|16|37|In the course of the last ten chapters I have argued that surveillance capitalism represents an unprecedented logic of accumulation defined by new economic imperatives whose mechanisms and effects cannot be grasped with existing models and assumptions. This is not to say that the old imperatives---a compulsion toward profit maximization along with the intensification of the means of production, growth, and competition---have vanished. However, these must now operate through the novel aims and mechanisms of surveillance capitalism. I briefly review the new imperatives here, both as a summary of the ground that we have covered and as prelude to the question *How did they get away with it?*|Chap 16, Para 37|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1478|16|38|"Surveillance capitalism's new story begins with *behavioral surplus* discovered more or less ready-made in the online environment, when it was realized that the ""data exhaust"" clogging Google's servers could be combined with its powerful analytic capabilities to produce predictions of user behavior. Those *prediction products* became the basis for a preternaturally lucrative sales process that ignited new *markets in future behavior.*"|Chap 16, Para 38|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1479|16|39|"Google's ""machine intelligence"" improved as the volume of data increased, producing better prediction products. This dynamic established *the extraction imperative,* which expresses the necessity of *economies of scale in surplus accumulation* and depends upon automated systems that relentlessly track, hunt, and induce more behavioral surplus. Google imposed the logic of conquest, defining human experience as free for the taking, available to be rendered as data and claimed as surveillance assets. The company learned to employ a range of rhetorical, political, and technological strategies to obfuscate these processes and their implications."|Chap 16, Para 39|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1480|16|40|The need for scale drove a relentless search for new high-volume supplies of behavioral surplus, producing competitive dynamics aimed at cornering these supplies of raw material and seeking lawless undefended spaces in which []to prosecute these unexpected and poorly understood acts of dispossession. All the while, surveillance capitalists stealthily but steadfastly habituated us to their claims. In the process, our access to necessary information and services became hostage to their operations, our means of social participation fused with their interests.|Chap 16, Para 40|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1481|16|41|Lucrative *prediction products* depend upon behavioral surplus, and competition drove the supply challenges to a new level, expressed in the *prediction imperative.* More-powerful prediction products required *economies of scope* as well as scale, variation as well as volume. This variation occurs along two dimensions. The first is *extension* across a wide range of activities; the second is the *depth* of predictive detail within each activity.|Chap 16, Para 41|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1482|16|42|In this new phase of competitive intensity, surveillance capitalists are forced from the virtual world into the real one. This migration necessitates new machine processes for the *rendition* of all aspects of human experience into behavioral data. Competition now occurs in the context of a rapidly evolving global architecture of ubiquitous computation and therefore ubiquitous supply opportunities, as prediction products are increasingly expected to approximate certainty and therefore to guarantee behavioral outcomes.|Chap 16, Para 42|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1483|16|43|In a third phase of competitive intensity, surveillance capitalists discovered the necessity of *economies of action* based on new methods that go beyond tracking, capturing, analyzing, and predicting behavior in order to intervene in the state of play and actively shape behavior at the source. The result is that the means of production are subordinated to an elaborate new *means of behavioral modification,* which relies upon a variety of machine processes, techniques, and tactics (tuning, herding, conditioning) to shape individual, group, and population behavior in ways that continuously improve their approximation to guaranteed outcomes. Just as industrial capitalism was driven to the continuous intensification of the means of production, so surveillance capitalists are now locked in a cycle of continuous intensification of the means of behavioral modification.|Chap 16, Para 43|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1484|16|44|Surveillance capitalists' interests have shifted from using automated machine processes to know about your behavior to using machine processes to shape your behavior according to their interests. In other words, this decade-and-a-half trajectory has taken us from *automating information flows about you* []to *automating you.* Given the conditions of increasing ubiquity, it has become difficult if not impossible to escape this audacious, implacable web.|Chap 16, Para 44|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1485|16|45|In order to reestablish our bearings, I have asked for a rebirth of astonishment and outrage. Most of all, I have asked that we reject the Faustian pact of participation for dispossession that requires our submission to the means of behavioral modification built on the foundation of the Google declarations. I am also mindful, though, that when we ask *How did they get away with it?* there are many compelling reasons to consider, no one of which stands alone. Instead of simple cause and effect, the answers to our question constitute a broad landscape of history, contingency, quicksand, and coercion.|Chap 16, Para 45|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1486|16|46|"Our question is even more vexing in light of the fact that in the great majority of surveys designed to probe public attitudes toward the loss of privacy and other elements of surveillance capitalist practices, few of us favor the status quo. In forty-six of the most prominent forty-eight surveys administered between 2008 and 2017, substantial majorities support measures for enhanced privacy and user control over personal data. (Only two early surveys were somewhat less conclusive, because so many participants indicated that they did not understand how or what personal information was being gathered.) Indeed, by 2008 it was well established that the more knowledge one has about ""internet privacy practices,"" the more one is likely to be very concerned about privacy."|Chap 16, Para 46|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1487|16|47|"Although the surveys vary in terms of their specific focus and questions, the general consistency of responses over the decade is noteworthy. For example, an important 2009 survey found that when Americans are informed of the ways that companies gather data for targeted online ads, 73--86 percent reject such advertising. Another substantial survey in 2015 found 91 percent of respondents disagreeing that the collection of personal information ""without my knowing"" is a fair trade-off for a price discount. Fifty-five percent disagreed that it was a fair exchange for improved services. In 2016 Pew Research reported only 9 percent of respondents as very confident in trusting social media sites with their data and 14 percent as very confident about trusting companies with personal data. More than 60 percent wanted to do more to protect their privacy and believed there should be more regulations to protect privacy."|Chap 16, Para 47|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1488|16|48|[]Surveillance capitalist firms have tended to dismiss these survey results, pointing instead to the spectacular growth of users and revenue. This discrepancy has confounded research and public policy. With so many people rejecting the practices of surveillance capitalism, even considering how little most of us actually know about these practices, how is it that this market form has been able to succeed? The reasons are plentiful:|Chap 16, Para 48|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1489|16|49|"1\. ***Unprecedented:*** Most of us did not resist the early incursions of Google, Facebook, and other surveillance capitalist operations because it was impossible to recognize the ways in which they differed from anything that had gone before. The basic operational mechanisms and business practices were so new and strange, so utterly sui generis, that all we could see was a gaggle of ""innovative"" horseless carriages. Most significantly, anxiety and vigilance have been fixed on the known threats of surveillance and control associated with state power. Earlier incursions of behavior modification at scale were understood as an extension of the state, and we were not prepared for the onslaught from private firms."|Chap 16, Para 49|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1490|16|50|2\. ***Declaration as invasion:*** The lack of precedence left us disarmed and charmed. Meanwhile, Google learned the art of invasion by declaration, taking what it wanted and calling it theirs. The corporation asserted its rights to bypass our awareness, to take our experience and transform it into data, to claim ownership of and decisions over the uses of those data, to produce strategies and tactics that keep us ignorant of its practices, and to insist on the conditions of lawlessness required for these operations. These declarations institutionalized surveillance capitalism as a market form.|Chap 16, Para 50|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1491|16|51|"3\. ***Historical context:*** Surveillance capitalism found shelter in the neoliberal zeitgeist that equated government regulation of business with tyranny. This ""paranoid style"" favored self-management regimes that imposed few limits on corporate practices. In a parallel development, the ""war on terror"" shifted the government's attention from privacy legislation to an urgent interest in the rapidly developing skills and technologies of Google and other rising surveillance capitalists. These ""elective affinities"" produced a trend toward surveillance exceptionalism, which further sheltered the new market form from scrutiny and nurtured its development."|Chap 16, Para 51|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1492|16|52|"4\. ***Fortifications:*** Google aggressively protected its operations by establishing its utilities in the electoral process, strong relationships with elected []and appointed officials, a revolving door of staffers between Washington and Silicon Valley, lavish lobbying expenditures, and a steady ""soft-power"" campaign of cultural influence and capture."|Chap 16, Para 52|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1493|16|53|5\. ***The dispossession cycle:*** First at Google and later at Facebook and other firms, surveillance capitalist leaders mastered the rhythms and stages of dispossession. Audacious incursions are pursued until resistance is met, followed by a range of tactics from elaborate public relations gambits to legal combat, all designed to buy time for gradual habituation to once-outrageous facts. A third stage features public demonstrations of adaptability and even retreat, while in the final stage resources are redirected to achieve the same objectives camouflaged by new rhetoric and tactics.|Chap 16, Para 53|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1494|16|54|6\. ***Dependency:*** The free services of Google, Facebook, and others appealed to the latent needs of second-modernity individuals seeking resources for effective life in an increasingly hostile institutional environment. Once bitten, the apple was irresistible. As surveillance capitalism spread across the internet, the means of social participation become coextensive with the means of behavioral modification. The exploitation of second-modernity needs that enabled surveillance capitalism from the start eventually imbued nearly every channel of social participation. Most people find it difficult to withdraw from these utilities, and many ponder if it is even possible.|Chap 16, Para 54|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1495|16|55|7\. ***Self-Interest:*** New markets in future behavior give rise to networks of fellow travelers, partners, collaborators, and customers whose revenues depend on the prediction imperative. Institutional facts proliferate. The pizzeria owner on the Pokémon Go map, the merchant who saturates his shop with beacons, and the insurance companies vying for behavioral data unite in the race toward guaranteed outcomes and surveillance revenues.|Chap 16, Para 55|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1496|16|56|8\. ***Inclusion:*** Many people feel that if you are not on Facebook, you do not exist. People all over the world raced to participate in Pokémon Go. With so much energy, success, and capital flowing into the surveillance capitalist domain, standing outside of it, let alone against it, can feel like a lonely and risky prospect.|Chap 16, Para 56|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1497|16|57|9\. ***Identification:*** Surveillance capitalists aggressively present themselves as heroic entrepreneurs. Many people identify with and admire the financial success and popularity of the surveillance capitalists and regard them as role models.|Chap 16, Para 57|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1498|16|58|[]10. ***Authority:*** Many also regard these corporations and their leaders as authorities on the future: geniuses who can see farther than the rest of us. It is easy to fall prey to the naturalistic fallacy, which suggests that because the companies are successful, they must also be right. As a result, many of us are respectful of these leaders' expert status and are eager to participate in innovations that anticipate the future.|Chap 16, Para 58|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1499|16|59|11\. ***Social persuasion:*** As we have seen repeatedly, there is an endless cascade of beguiling rhetoric aimed at persuading people of the wonders associated with surveillance capitalist innovations: targeted advertising, personalization, and digital assistants. Beyond that, economies of action are intentionally designed to persuade us to follow one another along prescribed courses of action.|Chap 16, Para 59|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1500|16|60|"12\. ***Foreclosed alternatives:*** The ""dictatorship of no alternatives"" is in full force here. We have seen that the behavioral value reinvestment cycle is increasingly rare. The Aware Home gave way to the Google Home. Surveillance capitalism spread across the internet, and the drive toward economies of scope and action has forced it out into the real world. From apps to devices to the One Voice, it is ever more difficult to identify avenues of escape, let alone genuine alternatives."|Chap 16, Para 60|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1501|16|61|13\. ***Inevitabilism:*** The Trojan horse of computer mediation---devices, apps, connection---enters the scene in a relentless deluge of inevitabilist rhetoric, successfully distracting us from the highly intentional and historically contingent surveillance capitalism within. New institutional facts proliferate and stabilize the new practices. We fall into resignation and a sense of helplessness.|Chap 16, Para 61|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1502|16|62|14\. ***The ideology of human frailty:*** In addition to inevitabilism, surveillance capitalism has eagerly weaponized behavioral economics' ideology of human frailty, a worldview that frames human mentation as woefully irrational and incapable of noticing the regularity of its own failures. Surveillance capitalists employ this ideology to legitimate their means of behavior modification: tuning, herding, and conditioning individuals and populations in ways that are designed to elude awareness.|Chap 16, Para 62|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1503|16|63|15\. ***Ignorance:*** This remains a salient explanation. Surveillance capitalists dominate an abnormal division of learning in which they know things that we cannot know while compelled to conceal their intentions and practices []in secret backstage action. It is impossible to understand something that has been crafted in secrecy and designed as fundamentally illegible. These systems are intended to ensnare us, preying on our vulnerabilities bred by an asymmetrical division of learning and amplified by our scarcity of time, resources, and support.|Chap 16, Para 63|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1504|16|64|"16\. ***Velocity:*** Surveillance capitalism rose from invention to domination in record time. This reflects its ability to attract capital and its laws of motion, but it also reflects a specific strategy in which velocity is consciously deployed to paralyze awareness and freeze resistance while distracting us with immediate gratifications. Surveillance capitalism's velocities outrun democracy even as they outrun our ability to understand what is happening and consider the consequences. This strategy is borrowed from a long legacy of political and military approaches to the production of speed as a form of violence, most recently known as ""shock and awe."""|Chap 16, Para 64|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1505|16|65|These sixteen answers suggest that in the nearly two decades since the invention of surveillance capitalism, existing laws, largely centered on privacy and antitrust, have not been sufficient to disrupt its growth. We need laws that reject the fundamental legitimacy of surveillance capitalism's declarations and interrupt its most basic operations, including the illegitimate rendition of human experience as behavioral data; the use of behavioral surplus as free raw material; extreme concentrations of the new means of production; the manufacture of prediction products; trading in behavioral futures; the use of prediction products for third-order operations of modification, influence, and control; the operations of the means of behavioral modification; the accumulation of private exclusive concentrations of knowledge (the shadow text); and the power that such concentrations confer.|Chap 16, Para 65|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1506|16|66|The rejection of these new institutions of surveillance capital and the declarations upon which they are built would signify a withdrawal of social agreement to surveillance capitalism's aims and methods in the same way that we once withdrew agreement to the antisocial and antidemocratic practices of raw industrial capitalism, righting the balance of power between employers and workers by recognizing workers' rights to collective bargaining and outlawing child labor, hazardous working conditions, excessive work hours, and so on.|Chap 16, Para 66|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1507|16|67|"The withdrawal of agreement takes two broad forms, a distinction that will be useful as we move into Part III. The first is what I call the []*counter-declaration.* These are defensive measures such as encryption and other privacy tools, or arguments for ""data ownership."" Such measures may be effective in discrete situations, but they leave the opposing facts intact, acknowledging their persistence and thus paradoxically contributing to their legitimacy. For example, if I ""opt out"" of tracking, I opt out for me, but my action does not challenge or alter the offending practice. The second form of disagreement is what I call the *synthetic declaration*. If the declaration is ""check,"" the counter-declaration is ""checkmate,"" and the synthetic declaration changes the game. It asserts an alternative framework that transforms the opposing facts. We bide our time with counter-declarations and make life more tolerable, but only a synthetic alternative vision will transform raw surveillance capitalism in favor of a digital future that we can call home."|Chap 16, Para 67|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1508|16|68|I turn to the history of the Berlin Wall as an illustration of these two forms of disagreement. From 1961 through the early 1980s, courageous East Berliners carved seventy-one tunnels through the sandy soil beneath the city, affording several hundred people a means of escape to West Berlin. The tunnels are testament to the necessity of counter-declarations, but they did not bring down the wall or the power that sustained it.|Chap 16, Para 68|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1509|16|69|"The synthetic declaration gathered force over decades, but its full expression would have to wait until near midnight on November 9, 1989, when Harald Jäger, the senior officer on duty that night at the Bornholmer Street passage, gave the order to open the gates, and twenty thousand people surged across the wall into West Berlin. As one historian describes that event, ""By the night of November 9, when the people appeared at the Berlin Wall and demanded to know of the border officials, *Will you let us pass?,* those people had become so certain of themselves, and the officials so unsure of themselves, that the answer was *We will*."""|Chap 16, Para 69|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1510|16|70|"Nearly seventy years ago, the economic historian Karl Polanyi reflected on the ways in which industrial capitalism's market dynamics would, if left unchecked, destroy the very things that it aimed to buy and sell: ""The commodity fiction disregarded the fact that leaving the fate of soil and people to the []market would be tantamount to annihilating them."" In the absence of synthetic declaration, Polanyi's prophecy appears headed for fulfillment, and this fact alone must put us on alert. What does Polanyi's prophecy augur for our time?"|Chap 16, Para 70|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1511|16|71|"Industrial capitalism followed its own logic of shock and awe, taking aim at nature to conquer ""it"" in the interests of capital; now surveillance capitalism has *human* nature in its sights. We have only gradually come to understand that the specific methods of domination employed by industrial capitalism for more than two centuries have fundamentally disoriented the conditions that support life on Earth, violating the most basic precepts of civilization. Despite the many benefits and immense accomplishments of industrial capitalism, it has left us perilously close to repeating the fate of the Easter Islanders, who wrecked the ground that gave them life, then fashioned statues to scan the horizon for the aid and succor that would never come. *If industrial capitalism dangerously disrupted nature, what havoc might surveillance capitalism wreak on human nature?*"|Chap 16, Para 71|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1512|16|72|"The answer to this question requires a return to imperatives. Industrial capitalism brought us to the brink of epic peril, but not as a consequence of an evil lust for destruction or runaway technology. Rather, this result was ineluctably driven by its own inner logic of accumulation, with its imperatives of profit maximization, competition, the relentless drive for labor productivity through the technological elaboration of production, and growth funded by the continuous reinvestment of surplus. It is Weber's ""economic orientation"" that matters, and how that orientation merges with the specific form of capitalism that rises to dominance in each age."|Chap 16, Para 72|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1513|16|73|The logic of industrial capitalism exempted the enterprise from responsibility for its destructive consequences, unleashing the destabilization of the climate system and the chaos it spells for all creatures. Polanyi understood that raw capitalism could not be cooked from within. He argued that it was up to society to impose those obligations on capitalism by insisting on measures that tether the capitalist project to the social, preserving and sustaining life and nature.|Chap 16, Para 73|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1514|16|74|Similarly, the meaning of Polanyi's prophecy for us now can be grasped only through the lens of surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives as they frame its claim to human experience. If we are to rediscover our sense []of astonishment, then let it be here: *if industrial civilization flourished at the expense of nature and now threatens to cost us the Earth, an information civilization shaped by surveillance capitalism will thrive at the expense of human nature and threatens to cost us our humanity.* Polanyi's prophecy requires us to ask if we may yet avert this fate with our own synthetic declarations.|Chap 16, Para 74|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1515|16|75|Parts I and II have been devoted to understanding the origins of surveillance capitalism and identifying, naming, and scrutinizing its foundational mechanisms and economic imperatives. The idea from the start was that naming and taming are inextricable, that fresh and careful naming can better equip us to intercept these mechanisms of dispossession, reverse their action, produce urgently needed friction, challenge the pathological division of learning, and ultimately synthesize new forms of information capitalism that genuinely meet our needs for effective life. Social participation and individual effectiveness should not require the sacrifice of our right to the future tense, which comprises our will to will, our autonomy, our decision rights, our privacy, and, indeed, our human natures.|Chap 16, Para 75|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1516|16|76|However, it would be wrong to suppose that surveillance capitalism can be grasped solely through the prism of its economic action or that the challenges we face are restricted to discerning, containing, and transforming its foundational mechanisms. The consequences of this new logic of accumulation have already leaked and continue to leak beyond commercial practices into the fabric of our social relations, transforming our relationships to ourselves and to one another. These transformations provide the soil in which surveillance capitalism has flourished: an invasive species that creates its own food supply. In transforming us, it produces nourishment for its own march forward.|Chap 16, Para 76|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1517|16|77|It is easier, perhaps, to see these dynamisms by looking to the past. The difference between industrial capitalism and industrial civilization is the difference between the economic operation and the societies it produced. The variant of industrial capitalism that rose to dominance in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced a specific kind of moral milieu that we sense intuitively even when we do not name it.|Chap 16, Para 77|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1518|16|78|Industrial capitalism was marked by the specialized division of labor, with its historically specific characteristics: the conversion of craft work to mass production based on standardization, rationalization, and the []interchangeability of parts; the moving assembly line; volume production; large populations of wage earners concentrated in factory settings; professionalized administrative hierarchies; managerial authority; functional specialization; and the distinction between white-collar work and blue-collar work.|Chap 16, Para 78|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1519|16|79|The list is illustrative, not exhaustive, but enough to remind us that industrial civilization was drawn from these expressions of the economic imperatives that ruled industrial expansion. The division of labor shaped culture, psychology, and social experience. The shift from craft to hourly wages created new populations of employees and consumers, men and women wholly dependent on the means of production owned and operated by private firms.|Chap 16, Para 79|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1520|16|80|This was the crucible of mass society, its hierarchical authority, and its centralized bureaucratic forms of public and private power, all of it haunted by the specters of conformity, obedience, and human standardization. Lives were defined by institutions that mirrored industrial organization: schools, hospitals, and even aspects of family and domestic life, in which ages and stages were understood as functions of the industrial system, from training to retirement.|Chap 16, Para 80|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1521|16|81|"At a time when surveillance capitalism has emerged as the dominant form of information capitalism, we must ask the question: what kind of civilization does it foretell? The chapters that follow in Part III are intended as an initial contribution to this urgent conversation. I have said that there can be no commitment to ""guaranteed outcomes"" without the power to make it so. What is the nature of this new power? How will it transform our societies? What solution for a third modernity does it proffer? What novel struggles will haunt these new days, and what do they portend for a digital future that we can call home? These are the questions that guide us into Part III. ::: :::  [][CHAPTER TWELVE](toc.xhtml#toc-chapter017) "|Chap 16, Para 81|16 THE RIGHT TO SANCTUARY
1522|17|5|"Under surveillance capitalism, the ""means of production"" serves the ""means of behavioral modification."" Machine processes replace human relationships so that certainty can replace trust. This new assembly relies upon a vast digital apparatus, world-historic concentrations of advanced computational knowledge and skill, and immense wealth. The arc of behavioral modification at scale integrates the many operations that we have examined: ubiquitous extraction and rendition, actuation (tuning, herding, conditioning), behavioral surplus supply chains, machine-intelligence--based manufacturing processes, fabrication of prediction products, dynamic behavioral futures markets, and ""targeting,"" which leads to fresh rounds of tuning, herding, conditioning, and the coercions of the uncontract, thus renewing the cycle."|Chap 17, Para 5|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1523|17|6|This assembly is a market project: its purpose is to fabricate predictions, which become more valuable as they approach certainty. The best predictions feed on totalities of data, and on the strength of this movement toward totality, surveillance capitalists have hijacked the division of learning in society. They command knowledge from the decisive pinnacle of the social order, []where they nourish and protect the shadow text: the urtext of certainty. This is the market net in which we are snared.|Chap 17, Para 6|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1524|17|7|In Parts I and II we examined the conditions, mechanisms, and operations that construct this private knowledge kingdom and its lucrative predictions that evolve toward certainty in order to guarantee market players the outcomes that they seek. As I wrote in [Chapter 7](chapter012.xhtml), there can be no *guarantee* of outcomes without the power to make it so. This is the dark heart of surveillance capitalism: a new type of commerce that reimagines us through the lens of its own distinctive power, mediated by its means of behavioral modification. What is this power, and how does it remake human nature for the sake of its lucrative certainties?|Chap 17, Para 7|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1525|17|8|"As to this species of power, I name it *instrumentarianism,* defined as *the instrumentation and instrumentalization of behavior for the purposes of modification, prediction, monetization, and control.* In this formulation, ""instrumentation"" refers to the puppet: the ubiquitous connected material architecture of sensate computation that renders, interprets, and actuates human experience. ""Instrumentalization"" denotes the social relations that orient the puppet masters to human experience as surveillance capital wields the machines to transform us into means to others' market ends. Surveillance capitalism forced us to reckon with an unprecedented form of capitalism. Now the instrumentarian power that sustains and enlarges the surveillance capitalist project compels a second confrontation with the unprecedented."|Chap 17, Para 8|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1526|17|9|"When scholars, civil society leaders, journalists, public figures, and, indeed, most of us speak out courageously against this new power, invariably we look to Orwell's Big Brother and more generally the specter of totalitarianism as the lens through which to interpret today's threats. Google, Facebook, and the larger field of commercial surveillance are frequently depicted as ""digital totalitarianism."" I admire those who have stood against the incursions of commercial surveillance, but I also suggest that the equation of instrumentarian power with totalitarianism impedes our understanding as well as our ability to resist, neutralize, and ultimately vanquish its potency. There is no historical precedent for instrumentarianism, but there is vivid precedent for this kind of encounter with an unprecedented new species of power."|Chap 17, Para 9|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1527|17|10|[]In the years before totalitarianism was named and formally analyzed, its critics appropriated the language of imperialism as the only framework at hand with which to articulate and resist the new power's murderous threats. Now surveillance capitalism has cast us adrift in another odd, dark sea of novel and thus indiscernible dangers. As scholars and citizens did before us, it is we who now reach for familiar vernaculars of twentieth-century power like lifesaving driftwood.|Chap 17, Para 10|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1528|17|11|"We are back to the syndrome of the horseless carriage, where we attach our new sense of peril to old, familiar facts, unaware that the conclusions to which they lead us are necessarily incorrect. Instead, we need to grasp the specific inner logic of a conspicuously twenty-first-century conjuring of power for which the past offers no adequate compass. Totalitarianism was bent on the reconstruction of the human species through the dual mechanisms of genocide and the ""engineering of the soul."" Instrumentarian power, as we shall see, takes us in a sharply different direction. Surveillance capitalists have no interest in murder or the reformation of our souls. Although their aims are in many ways just as ambitious as those of totalitarian leaders, they are also utterly distinct. The work of naming a strange form of power unprecedented in the human experience must begin anew for the sake of effective resistance and the creative power to insist on a future of our own making."|Chap 17, Para 11|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1529|17|12|"The remainder of this chapter prepares the way. The first task is to develop our understanding of what instrumentarian power is *not,* so in twentieth-century totalitarianism. Most important is the fact that, like instrumentarianism, totalitarian power was also unprecedented. It literally defied human comprehension. There is much that we can learn from the struggles and missteps of scholars, journalists, and citizens as they found themselves overwhelmed by a force that they could neither fathom nor resist. Once we have tackled these questions, we will be equipped to bear down on an exploration of instrumentarianism's origins in a field of intellectual endeavor that came to be known as ""radical behaviorism,"" most notably championed by B. F. Skinner and his dream of a ""technology of behavior."" In [Chapter 13](chapter018.xhtml) we integrate our insights to consider the unique aims and strategies of instrumentarian power."|Chap 17, Para 12|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1530|17|13|"The word *totalitarianism* first appeared in the early-twentieth-century work of Italian philosopher Giovanni Gentile and came into wider use later with Mussolini's *The Doctrine of Fascism,* cowritten in 1932 with Gentile, who was by then Italy's premier philosopher of fascism. Italy had entered the twentieth century as a second-rate country, ignored on the world stage, nursing a sense of failure and humiliation, and unable to support its own population as millions emigrated in search of a better life. In the first decade of the twentieth century a new generation of intellectuals and avant-garde futurists began to weave the dream of a ""new Italy."" Gentile dedicated his philosophical talents to this revival of nationalist zeal."|Chap 17, Para 13|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1531|17|14|"At the heart of Gentile's political philosophy is the concept of the ""total."" The state was to be understood as an inclusive organic unity that transcends individual lives. All separateness and difference are surrendered to the state for the sake of this superordinate totality. In 1932 Mussolini charged Gentile with writing the philosophical introduction to his book, while Mussolini authored the social and political principles that would define the fascist worldview. The *Doctrine* begins by declaring the fascist attitude as, above all, ""a spiritual attitude"" that penetrates the most intimate redoubt of each human participant:"|Chap 17, Para 14|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE

1533|17|16|"That year, the refashioning of the soul as the hallmark of the totalitarian impulse was immortalized by Stalin on a glittering, champagne-soaked []Moscow evening. The setting was an auspicious literary gathering hosted by a compliant Maxim Gorky in the sprawling mansion that Stalin had presented to the revered author upon his return to Russia from a self-imposed Italian exile. Stalin took the floor for a toast as the room fell silent. ""Our tanks are worthless if the souls who must steer them are made of clay. This is why I say: The production of souls is more important than that of tanks.... Man is reshaped by life itself, and those of you here must assist in reshaping his soul. That is what is important, the production of human souls. And that is why I raise my glass to you, writers, to the *engineers of the soul.*"" The authors assembled around Stalin that evening raised their glasses to his toast, persuaded perhaps by memories of less adaptive colleagues already exiled or executed, including the 1929 torture and murder of artists and writers in the Solovetsky Islands' aptly named Church of the Beheading."|Chap 17, Para 16|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1534|17|17|"By 1933, the term *totalitarianism* had begun to circulate widely in Germany. Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels adopted it, and German intellectuals declared the ""turn to totalitarianism."" Nazism also shifted the doctrine in an important way, asserting the ""movement,"" not the ""state,"" as the spiritual center of German totalitarianism, a relationship summarized during Hitler's first years as chancellor in National Socialism's popular slogan ""The movement gives orders to the state."""|Chap 17, Para 17|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1535|17|18|"That totalitarianism was a new species of power had confounded its analysis from the start, as both its Russian and German variants swept through those societies, challenging the foundations of Western civilization. Although these totalitarian regimes began to take root years before World War II---first in Russia in 1929 with Stalin's ascension to power and then in Germany in 1933 with Hitler's installation as chancellor---they eluded systematic study until the end of the war. Analysis was impeded in part by the sheer mystery and perpetual movement of the whole enterprise: the secret plans executed by secret police, the silent complicities and hidden atrocities, the ceaseless transformation of who or what was up or down, the intentional torsion of facts into anti-facts accompanied by a perpetual deluge of propaganda, misinformation, euphemism, and mendacity. The authoritative leader, or ""egocrat,"" to use the French philosopher Claude Lefort's term, displaces the rule of law and ""common"" sense to become the quixotic judge of what is just or unjust, truth or lie, at each moment."|Chap 17, Para 18|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1536|17|19|"[]Western publics, especially in the US, were genuinely unable to grasp the enormity of what was underway. It literally boggled minds. This intellectual paralysis is immortalized in the pages of a cultural icon of that era, *Look* magazine. Its August 15, 1939, issue featured an article titled ""What's Going On in Russia?"" written by *New York Times* former Moscow bureau chief and Pulitzer Prize winner Walter Duranty. The piece appeared just months after the conclusion of the Great Terror, when, between 1937 and population, from poets to diplomats, generals to political loyalists. According to Soviet historian Robert Conquest, that two-year period saw seven million arrests, one million executions, two million deaths in labor camps, one million people imprisoned, and another seven million people still in camps by the end of 1938."|Chap 17, Para 19|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1537|17|20|"Despite the immediacy of catastrophic evil, Duranty's article describes the Constitution of the USSR as one of the ""the most democratic in the world... a foundation on which a future democracy may be built."" In addition to praiseworthy descriptions of the Red Army, free education and medical care, communal housing, and equality of the sexes, there is an upbeat commentary in which the ""great purge"" is breezily described as ""one of the periodic cleansings of the Communist Party."" Duranty reports that this ""cleansing"" is ""now over,"" and people are ""repairing the damage,"" as if the country were tidying up after a particularly nasty winter storm. In fact, the Stalinist pattern of violence, imprisonment, exile, and execution merely shifted its focus with a swift and terrifying ferocity to the Baltic and eastern Poland. Among the many atrocities between 1939 and 1941, hundreds of thousands of Poles were marched to northern labor camps, and tens of thousands of members of the Polish Communist Party were murdered. Just one week after Duranty's article, Stalin signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler, attacked Poland in September, and in November the Red Army invaded Finland. In 1940 Stalin ordered the massacre of 15,000 Polish nationalists taken as prisoners of war in the 1939 attack."|Chap 17, Para 20|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1538|17|21|"The most startling feature of Duranty's essay is its characterization of Stalin himself. There, sandwiched between a celebratory feature on a newly released film called *The Wizard of Oz* and a lengthy spread on embarrassing celebrity pictures, such as the famed ventriloquist's dummy Charlie McCarthy with a cigarette in his wooden mouth, is a photo of a handsome smiling []Joseph Stalin captioned ""Stalin, chairman of the inner circle of the Communist Party... does not lay down the law as Lenin did. Stalin prefers to hear the views of his associates before he makes his own decision."" Stalin's 1939 lionization in *Look* as an exemplar of participatory management was followed a few months later with his ascension to *Time* magazine's cover as ""Man of the Year."" Indeed, between 1930 and his death in 1953, Stalin made a total of ten appearances on the cover of *Time.* All of this provides some sense of totalitarianism's elaboration and institutionalization long before it was identified and analyzed as a coherent new form of power that, as many scholars would conclude, posed history's greatest threat to civilization."|Chap 17, Para 21|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1539|17|22|"With a few important exceptions, it was only after the Nazi defeat that the program of naming began in earnest. ""Plenty of information was available contradicting the official picture,"" writes Conquest. He asks why ""journalists, sociologists, and other visitors"" were taken in by the Soviet regime's lies. One reason is that the Soviet government went to a great deal of trouble to present a false picture, including ""model prisons"" that betrayed no trace of the immense state machinery of torture and death. Another reason was the credulity of the observers themselves. In some cases, like Duranty's, they were blinded by an ideological allegiance to the idea of a socialist state."|Chap 17, Para 22|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1540|17|23|"The most compelling reason of all is that in most of these cases, journalists, scholars, and Western governments had a difficult time reckoning the full weight of totalitarianism's monstrous achievements because the actual facts were so ""improbable"" that it was difficult even for specialists to grasp their truth. ""The Stalin epoch,"" writes Conquest, ""is replete with what appear as improbabilities to minds unfitted to deal with the phenomena."" This failure of comprehension has immediate significance for us as we learn to reckon with surveillance capitalism and its new instrumentarian power."|Chap 17, Para 23|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1541|17|24|"The confrontation with totalitarianism's impossibility is reflected in the moving accounts of the first scholars determined to lift the veil on that era's gruesome truths. Nearly every intellectual who turned to this project in the period immediately following the war cites the feeling of astonishment at the suddenness with which, as Harvard political scientist Carl Friedrich put it, totalitarianism had ""burst upon mankind... unexpected and unannounced."" Its manifestations were so novel and unanticipated, so shocking, rapid, and unparalleled, that all of it eluded language, challenging every tradition, norm, []value, and legitimate form of action. The systematic accretion of violence and complicity that engulfed whole populations at extreme velocity invoked a kind of bewilderment that ended in paralysis, even for many of the greatest minds of the twentieth century."|Chap 17, Para 24|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1542|17|25|"Friedrich was among the first scholars of totalitarianism to address this experience of improbability, writing in 1954 that ""virtually no one before 1914 anticipated the course of development which has overtaken Western civilization since then... none of the outstanding scholars in history, law, and the social sciences discerned what was ahead... which culminated in totalitarianism. To this failure to foresee corresponds a difficulty in comprehending."" Not even the most farsighted of the early-century interpreters of industrial society, thinkers such as Durkheim and Weber, had anticipated this murderous turn. Hannah Arendt described the defeat of Nazi Germany as ""the first chance to try to tell and to understand what had happened... still in grief and sorrow and... a tendency to lament, but no longer in speechless outrage and impotent horror."""|Chap 17, Para 25|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1543|17|26|"Ultimately, a courageous and brilliant body of scholarship would evolve to meet the challenge of comprehension. It yielded different models and schools of thought, each with distinct emphasis and insights, but these shared common purpose in finally naming the great evil. ""Totalitarianism has discovered a means of dominating and terrorizing human beings from within,"" wrote Arendt, the German-born philosopher who would spend the six years after World War II writing her extraordinary study of totalitarian power, published in 1951 as *The Origins of Totalitarianism.*"|Chap 17, Para 26|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1544|17|27|"Arendt's was a detailed disclosure and a pioneering attempt to theorize what had just occurred. ""Comprehension,"" she said, is the necessary response to the ""truly radical nature of Evil"" disclosed by totalitarianism. ""It means... examining and bearing consciously the burden which our century has placed on us---neither denying its existence nor submitting meekly to its weight."" Totalitarianism was bent on the ""destruction of humanity"" and ""the essence of man,"" and, she insisted, ""to turn our backs on the destructive forces of the century is of little avail."" Essential to totalitarianism was the deletion of all ties and sources of meaning other than ""the movement"": ""Total loyalty---the psychological basis for domination---can be expected only from the completely isolated human being who, without any other social ties to family, []friends, comrades, or even mere acquaintances, derives his sense of having a place in the world only from his belonging to a movement, his membership in the party."""|Chap 17, Para 27|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1545|17|28|"Mid-century scholars such as Friedrich, Adorno, Gurian, Brzezinski, and Aron added to these themes, recognizing totalitarianism's insistence on domination of the human soul. To command populations right down to their souls requires unimaginable effort, which was one reason why totalitarianism was unimaginable. It requires henchmen, and their henchmen, and their henchmen, all willing to roll up both sleeves and thrust both hands into the blood and shit of actual living persons whose bodies stink and sweat and cry out in terror, grief, and pain. It measures success at the cellular level, penetrating to the quick, where it subverts and commands each unspoken yearning in pursuit of the genocidal vision that historian Richard Shorten calls ""the experiment in reshaping humanity."""|Chap 17, Para 28|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1546|17|29|"The destruction and reconstruction of society and the purification of the human species were prosecuted in the name of ""class"" in Stalin's Soviet Union and ""race"" in Hitler's Germany. Each regime invented ""out-groups"" slated for murder---the Jewish people, Romanies, homosexuals, and revolutionaries in Germany and Eastern Europe, whole segments of the population in Stalin's Russia---and ""in-groups"" required to submit body and soul to the regime. In this way totalitarian regimes could achieve their fantastical aim of the ""People-as-one,"" as Claude Lefort describes it: ""Social unanimity corresponds to inner unanimity, held in place by hatred activated toward the 'enemies of the people.'"""|Chap 17, Para 29|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1547|17|30|"Totalitarian power cannot succeed by remote control. Mere conformity is insufficient. Each individual inner life must be claimed and transformed by the perpetual threat of punishment without crime. Mass murder warrants economies of scale---the camps, massacres, and gulags---but for the rest it would be a handmade terror that aims to remake every aspect of the individual from the inside out: heart, mind, sexuality, personality, and spirit. This craftwork requires the detailed orchestration of isolation, anxiety, fear, persuasion, fantasy, longing, inspiration, torture, dread, and surveillance. Arendt describes the relentless process of ""atomization"" and fusion in which terror destroys the ordinary human bonds of law, norms, trust, and affection, ""which provide the living space for the freedom of the individual."" The ""iron []band"" of terror ""mercilessly presses men... against each other so that the very space of free action... disappears."" Terror ""fabricates the oneness of all men."""|Chap 17, Para 30|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1548|17|31|Instrumentarian power moves differently and toward an opposite horizon. Totalitarianism operated through the means of violence, but instrumentarian power operates through the means of behavioral modification, and this is where our focus must shift. Instrumentarian power has no interest in our souls or any principle to instruct. There is no training or transformation for spiritual salvation, no ideology against which to judge our actions. It does not demand possession of each person from the inside out. It has no interest in exterminating or disfiguring our bodies and minds in the name of pure devotion. It welcomes data on the behavior of our blood and shit, but it has no interest in soiling itself with our excretions. It has no appetite for our grief, pain, or terror, although it eagerly welcomes the behavioral surplus that leaches from our anguish. It is profoundly and infinitely indifferent to our meanings and motives. Trained on measurable action, it only cares that whatever we do is *accessible* to its ever-evolving operations of rendition, calculation, modification, monetization, and control.|Chap 17, Para 31|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1549|17|32|Although it is not murderous, instrumentarianism is as startling, incomprehensible, and new to the human story as totalitarianism was to its witnesses and victims. Our encounter with unprecedented power helps to explain why it has been difficult to name and know this new species of coercion, shaped in secret, camouflaged by technology and technical complexity, and obfuscated by endearing rhetoric. Totalitarianism was a political project that converged with economics to overwhelm society. Instrumentarianism is a market project that converges with the digital to achieve its own unique brand of social domination.|Chap 17, Para 32|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1550|17|33|"It is not surprising, therefore, that instrumentarianism's specific ""viewpoint of observation"" was forged in the controversial intellectual domain known as ""radical behaviorism"" and its antecedents in turn-of-the-century theoretical physics. In the remainder of this chapter, our examination of []power in the time of surveillance capitalism pivots to this point of origin far from totalitarianism's murder and mayhem. It takes us to laboratories and classrooms and the realms of thought spun by men who regarded freedom as a synonym for ignorance and human beings as distant organisms imprisoned in patterns of behavior beyond their own comprehension or control, such as ants, bees, or Stuart MacKay's herds of elk."|Chap 17, Para 33|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1551|17|34|"In a 1971 cover story, *Time* magazine described Burrhus Frederic ""B. F."" Skinner as ""an institution at Harvard... the most influential of living American psychologists, and the most controversial contemporary figure in the science of human behavior, adored as a messiah and abhorred as a menace."" Skinner spent most of his career in the Psychology Department at Harvard University, and some of my most vivid memories of graduate school are the times I spent with him in close debate. I admit that those conversations did little to alter our respective views, but they left me with an indelible sense of fascination with a way of construing human life that was---and is---fundamentally different from my own."|Chap 17, Para 34|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1552|17|35|"As an academic psychologist, Skinner was famous for the ingenious tools and techniques he invented to study animal behavior---first in the ancient murky basement of Memorial Hall and later on the seventh floor of the newly constructed William James Hall---as well as the insights that he and his students developed into the shaping of that behavior: pigeons and levers, pigeons and pellets, pigeons on hotplates, rats in mazes. His early research broke new ground as he engineered variable ""schedules of reinforcement"" to produce detailed patterns of activity that were foreign to an animal's original behavioral repertoire, work that he called ""operant conditioning."""|Chap 17, Para 35|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1553|17|36|"Inspired by his effort during World War II to transform a flock of pigeons into the conditioned intelligence for guided missiles (one that did not ultimately come to fruition), Skinner set out on a new path defined by the promise of behavioral engineering. In 1947 he told a symposium, ""It is not a matter of bringing the world into the laboratory, but of extending the practices of an experimental science *to the world at large.* We can do this as []soon as we wish to do it."" The missile project had cast the meaning of his experimental work ""in a new light,"" he reflected years later in his autobiography. ""It was no longer merely an experimental analysis. It had given rise to a technology."""|Chap 17, Para 36|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1554|17|37|"Skinner was eager to apply his laboratory insights to the world's ills despite precious few grounds for his inferential leaps. As a public intellectual, he spent nearly seven decades trying to persuade the public that his radical behaviorism offered the principles of social organization necessary to defend civilization from cataclysm. He brashly extrapolated from the conduct of beleaguered animals to grand theories of social behavior and human evolution in books such as his 1948 ""utopian"" novel *Walden Two* and his 1971 social philosophy *Beyond Freedom & Dignity.* In 1974 Skinner published *About Behaviorism,* another explanation of the radical behaviorist project, this time addressed to a general readership. It aimed to counter the opposition to his views that had grown even more virulent since the unusual---and, to many, repugnant---arguments advanced in *Beyond Freedom & Dignity.* He regarded such opposition as the result of an ""extraordinary misunderstanding,"" and he was tireless in his efforts to reverse public opinion. He believed that once people correctly understood his meaning, they would certainly agree with his message."|Chap 17, Para 37|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1555|17|38|"In the very first pages of *About Behaviorism,* Skinner ignores the outrage generated by *Beyond Freedom & Dignity,* instead delving into behaviorism's roots and its earliest theorists and practitioners. He places much of the blame for the antipathy toward behaviorism on the man who is widely regarded as its founder, John B. Watson. It was Watson who famously announced in 1913 the behaviorist point of view: ""Psychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods.... The behaviorist... recognizes... no dividing line between man and brute."" But Watson turned out to be as much showman as scientist, and Skinner bitterly criticizes his extreme claims and ""shortage of facts"" that cast lasting doubt on radical behaviorism."|Chap 17, Para 38|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1556|17|39|"Having identified Watson as the main author of the problem, Skinner then credits the work of Max Meyer, an obscure early-twentieth-century German-trained experimental psychologist who spent most of his career at []the University of Missouri, as key to the solution. Meyer had pursued his doctoral studies at the University of Berlin, where his dissertation advisor, Max Planck, was destined to become one of the most celebrated physicists of all time. Planck insisted on the unity of the physical world and the discoverability of the natural laws that would disclose their secrets only through mathematical analysis, including the laws of human behavior. ""The outside world is something independent from man, something absolute,"" Planck wrote. ""The quest for the laws which apply to this absolute appeared... as the most sublime scientific pursuit in life."" Meyer carried Planck's teaching into his quest for the principles that would finally elevate the study of human behavior to true scientific status."|Chap 17, Para 39|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1557|17|40|"According to Skinner, Meyer succeeded in achieving the breakthrough that finally allowed psychology to assume its rightful place alongside the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Why did Skinner extol this work that had been largely ignored, even in its own time? Skinner singles out for special praise a 1921 textbook that bore the ominous-sounding title *Psychology of the Other-One*. It received scant attention when it was published---Meyer had written it primarily for his own students---and had since fallen into total obscurity. Nonetheless, Skinner praised the book for establishing the epistemological and methodological foundations of modern behaviorism: ""consider only those facts which can be objectively observed in the behavior of one person in its relation to his prior environmental history."" In Skinner's formulation, Meyer's book was a turning point, bravely combining psychology and physics in the quest for absolutes. It asserted the essence of the behaviorist's point of view, where ""the world within the skin of the Other-One loses its preferred status."""|Chap 17, Para 40|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1558|17|41|"The phrase that captured the new scientific perspective was the ""Other-One."" Human behavior would yield to scientific research only if psychologists learned to view humans as *others.* This ""viewpoint of observation"" was an absolute requirement for an ""objective science of human behavior"" that ceased to confuse inner experience with external action. Central to this new viewpoint was his notion of the human being as *organism.* The human being is recast as an ""it,"" an ""other,"" a ""they"" of organisms: an ""organism among organisms,"" distinguishable from a lettuce, a moose, or an inchworm only in degree of complexity. A scientific psychology would restrict its interests to []the social and therefore visible behaviors of this ""organism as an organism."" It would be ""the study of the life of the Other-One---but of his life in so far as it is of social significance rather than as it is of significance for himself.... We are studying the Other-One in preference to Our-Selves."""|Chap 17, Para 41|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1559|17|42|"The logical consequences of the new viewpoint necessitated a reinterpretation of the higher-order human experiences that we call ""freedom"" and ""will."" Meyer echoed Planck in positing that ""freedom of action in the animal world signifies the same that is meant by accidents in the world of physics."" Such accidents are simply phenomena for which there are insufficient information and understanding. And so it goes with freedom. The liberal idea of freedom persists in an inverse relationship to the growth of scientific knowledge, especially in the field of psychological science. Knowledge and freedom are necessarily adversaries. As Meyer wrote, ""The Other-One's conduct is free, uncaused, only in the same sense in which the issue of a disease, the outcome of a war, the weather, the crops are free and uncaused; that is, in the sense of general human ignorance of the particular causes of the particular outcome."""|Chap 17, Para 42|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1560|17|43|Decades later, this worldview would define the core of the controversial social philosophy espoused in *Beyond Freedom & Dignity,* in which Skinner argues that knowledge does not make us free but rather releases us from the illusion of freedom. In reality, he writes, freedom and ignorance are synonyms. The acquisition of knowledge is heroic in that it rescues us from ignorance, but it is also tragic because it necessarily reveals the impossibility of freedom.|Chap 17, Para 43|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1561|17|44|"For Meyer and for Skinner, our attachments to notions such as freedom, will, autonomy, purpose, and agency are defense mechanisms that protect us from the uncomfortable facts of human ignorance. I think of Dickens's Scrooge when he first encounters the doleful, chain-dragging ghost of his deceased partner Jacob Marley and denies the apparition, saying, ""You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato."" So it is with freedom: an undigested bit of fear, a crumb of denial that, once metabolized, will dispel the apparition and deliver us to reality. The environment determines behavior, and our ignorance of precisely how it does so is the void that we fill with the fantasy of freedom."|Chap 17, Para 44|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1562|17|45|"Meyer took great pains to insist that the significance of human inwardness---""soul,"" ""self,"" ""mind,"" ""consciousness""---is restricted to the []subjective life of the individual. It can have no scientific value because it cannot be observed and measured: ""We do not deny the soul, but we do not devote our time to it. We find enough, and more than enough, to do studying the body."" The soul is ""your own business,"" an intimate experience and irreducible mystery that are formally exempt from scientific inquiry: ""Human societies can thus be understood as originating from natural laws, not in the sense of groups of souls tho, but in the sense of groups of organisms."""|Chap 17, Para 45|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1563|17|46|Meyer argued that the future of the social sciences and of civilization itself rested on this shift from soul to other, inside to outside, lived experience to observable behavior. The otherization of humanity was to be the road to a new kind of political liberation. History's grim cavalcade of repression, torture, massacre, enslavement, and genocide had been prosecuted in the name of the domination of the human soul for the sake of religious or political power. From Meyer's vantage point in the Missouri of 1921 during those years after the Great War, his solution for an efficient and rational modernity must have felt like a matter of life and death:|Chap 17, Para 46|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1564|17|47|:::  He whose interest is centered in souls thinks, when he has forced others to speak his prayer, pronounce his creed, kneel before his altar, that he has saved their souls, and fails to admit that he has merely forced their bodies.... Political terrorism, too, has its main and inexhaustible source in the human tendency to think of other beings, not as bodies open to scientific investigation, but as souls, as mysterious beings, to be governed either by magic, or, if magic fails as it naturally must, by torture and death.... Recall the horrors of the torture... of such courts as the Spanish inquisition or the witch-craft courts of the 17th century.... These atrocities were due to the fact that the judge was serving as a mind reader, and that the accused was regarded primarily as a soul. :::|Chap 17, Para 47|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1565|17|48|"In Meyer's thinking, the shift in perspective from ""the human being as a soul"" to ""the human being as an organism"" explained ""why the trend of history is in the direction of democracy."" As science overtakes civilization, Meyer assumed a new global recognition of equality and democratic fellowship rooted in the basic fact of our overwhelming similarity as fellow []organisms. The divisions that haunt society, politics, and economics based on class, wealth, liberality, race, and so on would become ridiculous: ""In real world-wide human life, the differences among individuals are entirely swamped by their likenesses. To him who accepts the scientific view that human society is a group of organisms, it is an absurd proposition to divide... into... classes...."""|Chap 17, Para 48|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1566|17|49|"Meyer believed that every social science that aspired to true scientific status would embrace the viewpoint of the Other-One---psychology, of course, but also sociology, economics, criminology, history, and the psychology of religion: ""Christ going among his fellow men, an organism among organisms...."" Otherizing would pave the way to a rational future, with its bleak satisfactions that resign humanity to the forfeit of freedom as the price of knowledge."|Chap 17, Para 49|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1567|17|50|"Skinner's commitment to the viewpoint of the Other-One was unshakable, and it is through his elaboration of this viewpoint that we can begin to grasp the essence of instrumentarian power. From the opening page of Skinner's first book, *The Behavior of Organisms,* published in 1938, he sounds Meyer's (and Planck's) caution: freedom is merely ignorance waiting to be conquered. ""Primitive systems of behavior"" assign causality to ""entities beyond man."" Equally inadequate are the ""advanced systems of behavior"" that ascribe control to vague fictions such as the ""self"" or ""free will."" ""The inner organism,"" he wrote, ""may in resignation be called free, as in the case of 'free will,' when no further investigation is held to be possible."""|Chap 17, Para 50|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1568|17|51|"Skinner called his work ""radical behaviorism,"" insisting that the only meaningful object of behavioral study was observation of action devoid of subjective attributions. That's what made it radical. ""Behavior is what an organism is doing---or more accurately what it is observed by another organism to be doing,"" he declared in his first book's opening pages. ""Operant"" behavior was his term for this active, observable ""doing."" The vocabulary for rendering descriptions of operant behavior was to be purged of inwardness: an organism cannot be said to ""see"" but rather to ""look toward."" Only such []objective descriptions can render measurable behavioral facts that, in turn, lead to patterns and ultimately to the documentation of causal relationships between environment and behavior."|Chap 17, Para 51|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1569|17|52|"Skinner published *Science and Human Behavior* in 1951, positing that all observation, even of one's own behavior, must be enacted from the viewpoint of the Other-One. This discipline makes it possible to take almost anything as an object of behavioral analysis, including inferred behaviors such as ""making choices"" or ""problem solving,"" the very perspective that would later be amply exploited by the new discipline of behavioral economics:"|Chap 17, Para 52|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1570|17|53|:::  When a man controls himself, chooses a course of action, thinks out the solution to a problem, or strives toward an increase in self-knowledge, he is *behaving*. He controls himself precisely as he would control the behavior of anyone else---through the manipulation of variables of which behavior is a function. His behavior in so doing is a proper object of analysis, and eventually it must be accounted for with variables lying outside the individual himself. :::|Chap 17, Para 53|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1571|17|54|"In nearly every book and article, Skinner declared the truth that Planck taught Meyer and Meyer imparted to his students, the single truth that can be grasped only through the viewpoint of the Other-One: *freedom is ignorance.* The felt experience of free will is but a bit of undigested denial, produced by a lack of information about the actual determinants of behavior. Like Meyer and Planck before him, Skinner regarded freedom as an ""accident,"" arguing that the very notion of ""accident"" is illusory, a snapshot in time that reveals a lacuna waiting to be filled and eventually transformed by advancing knowledge into an expression of a lawful, predictable pattern. Under the behaviorist's gaze, these lacunae of ignorance that we mistake for free will are queuing up for explanation, rather like someone who consigns his or her body to cryonic preservation in the hope of some future awakening and cure."|Chap 17, Para 54|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1572|17|55|"In the most audacious of Skinner's literary efforts, the extended philosophical essay published in 1971 as *Beyond Freedom & Dignity,* he repeats: ""There is no virtue in the accidental nature of an accident."" That entire work was trained on what Skinner continued to regard as the chief impediment to social progress: the conceptual confusion that cloaks our deepest ignorance []in the sacred robes of freedom and dignity. Skinner argued that our allegiance to these lofty notions is simply the way we protect ourselves from the hard truths of ""unsuspected controlling relations between behavior and environment."" They are a psychological ""escape route"" that slowly closes ""as new evidences of the predictability of human behavior are discovered. Personal exemption from a complete determinism is revoked as a scientific analysis progresses... the achievements for which a person himself is to be given credit seem to approach zero... the behavior we admire is therefore the behavior we cannot yet explain."""|Chap 17, Para 55|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1573|17|56|"Richard Herrnstein, one of Skinner's most-accomplished students, later his colleague in Harvard's Psychology Department, and a luminary of radical behaviorism, once explained to me that any action regarded as an expression of free will is simply one for which ""the vortex of stimuli"" that produced it cannot yet be adequately specified. We merely lack the means of observation and calculation. I was a twenty-three-year-old student, and the term was new and startling to me. I never forgot that conversation, perhaps because it came as close as any to summarizing the behaviorist's conception of God. Indeed, there was a time when if you took the elevator to Skinner's lab on the seventh floor of the Psychology Department, the first thing you would see was a sign reading ""God is a VI,"" a variable interval of behavioral reinforcement plucked from the vortex."|Chap 17, Para 56|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1574|17|57|"In this view, ""freedom"" or ""accidents"" shrink as our developing capabilities in measurement and computation provide more information about the vortex of stimuli. Ignorance about human behavior is like a melting iceberg on a warming planet, destined to yield to the mounting heat as we invent the means and methods smart enough to first decipher and then control the vortex of stimuli that shapes each fact of human behavior. Skinner pointed to weather forecasting as the iconic example of this transformation from ignorance to law, just as Meyer had done decades earlier:"|Chap 17, Para 57|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1575|17|58|:::  The problems imposed by the complexity of a subject matter must be dealt with as they arise. Apparently hopeless cases often become manageable in time. It is only recently that any sort of lawful account of the weather has been possible.... Self-determination does not follow from complexity.... Difficulty in calculating the orbit of the fly []does not prove capriciousness, though it may make it impossible to prove anything else. :::|Chap 17, Para 58|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1576|17|59|"Through six decades of academic and popular writing, Skinner would insist that ""further investigation"" is always possible. In the first pages of *Beyond Freedom & Dignity* he calls for a technological solution to ignorance: ""We need to make vast changes in human behavior, and we cannot make them with the help of nothing more than physics or biology, no matter how hard we try... what we need is a technology of behavior... comparable in power and precision to physical and biological technology...."""|Chap 17, Para 59|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1577|17|60|"Skinner imagined technologies that would pervasively institutionalize the viewpoint of the Other-One as they observed, computed, analyzed, and automatically reinforced behavior to accomplish the ""vast changes"" that he believed were necessary. In this way the laws of human action would finally be illuminated so that behavior could be effectively predicted and shaped, just as other technologies had enabled physics and biology to change the world: ""The difference is that the instruments and methods they use are of commensurate complexity. The fact that *equally powerful instruments and methods are not available in the field of human behavior* is not an explanation; it is only part of the puzzle."""|Chap 17, Para 60|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1578|17|61|"Skinner concluded that the literature of freedom and dignity ""stands in the way of further human achievement."" He argued that the missing puzzle piece holding back the urgent development of the ""instruments and methods"" essential for a technology of behavior was the stubborn allegiance to these antique notions among people determined to preserve ""due credit"" for their actions. The belief in ""autonomous man"" is a regressive source of resistance to a rational future, an ""alternative explanation of behavior"" that obstructs the advancement of society."|Chap 17, Para 61|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1579|17|62|"The professor believed that humanity desperately needed a plan, and he imagined powerful new instruments that could engineer behavior in every domain. As early as 1953, he anticipated today's digitally engineered casino environments, whose sophistication in the precise shaping of gamblers' []behavior has made them a testing ground for state security agencies and surveillance capitalists alike: ""But with proper instrumentation it should be possible to improve upon established practices in all these fields. Thus gambling devices could be 'improved'---*from the point of view of the proprietor*---by introducing devices which would pay off on a variable-interval basis, but only when the rate of play is exceptionally high."""|Chap 17, Para 62|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1580|17|63|"Technologies of behavioral engineering would not be restricted to ""devices"" but would also encompass organizational systems and procedures designed to shape behavior toward specific ends. In 1953 Skinner anticipated innovations such as Michael Jensen's incentive systems designed to maximize shareholder value and the ""choice architectures"" of behavioral economics designed to ""nudge"" behavior along a preferred path: ""Schedules of pay in industry, salesmanship, and the professions, and the use of bonuses, incentive wages, and so on, could also be improved from the point of view of generating maximal productivity."""|Chap 17, Para 63|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1581|17|64|"Skinner understood that the engineering of behavior risked violating individual sensibilities and social norms, especially concerns about privacy. In order to allay these anxieties he advised that observation must be unobtrusive, ideally remaining outside the awareness of the organism: ""Behavior may also be observed with a minimum of interaction between subject and scientist, and this is the case with which one naturally tries to begin."" But there would be challenges. New technologies of behavior would have to continually push the envelope of the public-private divide in order to access all the data relevant to behavioral prediction and control. In this he anticipated today's rendition frontier as new detection systems plumb the depths of personalities and emotions: ""But we are still faced with events which occur at the private level and which are important to the organism without instrumental amplification. How the organism reacts to these events will remain an important question, even though the events may some day be made accessible to everyone."""|Chap 17, Para 64|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1582|17|65|"Such conflicts would be resolved, Skinner reckoned, by the gradual retreat of privacy norms as they fall to the advance of knowledge: ""The line between public and private is not fixed."" Like today's surveillance capitalists, he was confident that the slow drip of technological invention would eventually push privacy to the margins of human experience, where it would join []""freedom"" and other troublesome illusions. All these would be replaced by the viewpoint of the Other-One embodied in new instruments and methods: ""The boundary shifts with every discovery of a technique for making private events public.... The problem of privacy may, therefore, eventually be solved by technical advances."""|Chap 17, Para 65|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1583|17|66|Although privacy advocates and many other critics of surveillance capitalism are quick to appropriate Orwellian language in the search for meaning and metaphor that capture the sense of new menace, surveillance capital's instrumentarian power is best understood as the precise antithesis of Orwell's Big Brother. We now turn to this stark contrast, most vividly represented in the distinct conceptions of utopia that attach to each of these two species of power.|Chap 17, Para 66|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1584|17|67|"In the blood-soaked wake of World War II, both Skinner and the journalist and novelist George Orwell aimed curative, ""utopian"" novels at the mayhem of modernity's diminished prospects produced by an incomprehensible scale of violence. Viewed from a distance, Skinner's *Walden Two,* published in 1948, and Orwell's *1984,* released the following year, had much in common. Each elaborated a complete conception of a distinct logic of power, each imagined a society defined by the full flourishing of that power, and each was utopian from the point of view of the form of power that it described. However, their public reception could not have been more different: *Walden Two* was dismissed as a dystopian nightmare and ignored by the general public for more than a decade. Orwell's *1984* was immediately canonized as a dystopian masterpiece and the distillation of the twentieth century's worst nightmares."|Chap 17, Para 67|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1585|17|68|"The two utopias have often been confused with each other in their content and aims: *Time* magazine's 1971 cover story on Skinner described *Walden Two* as raising ""the specter of a 1984 Orwellian society that might really come to pass."" The great historian and literary critic Lewis Mumford once described *Walden Two* as a ""totalitarian utopia"" and a depiction of ""hell,"" but in fact these characterizations are a persistent and, as we shall see, []dangerous confusion. Although both books have been described as depictions of totalitarianism, the forms of power that each describes are profoundly different. In most respects, they are precise opposites."|Chap 17, Para 68|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1586|17|69|"Meyer's prescription for modernity was founded on the scientific objectification of human experience and its reduction to observable measurable behavior. If we take that as our benchmark here, then Orwell's utopia is the ""before"" case; it precedes Meyer as a nightmare of the prescientific compulsion to dominate the soul. Skinner's utopia is ""after"" Meyer's reimagining of modernity, as channeled from the great physicist, Planck. *Walden Two* is built on Meyer's scientific viewpoint of observation, the Other-One, and represents the full flower of Meyer's hope for a scientifically induced global harmony of organisms in which freedom is necessarily forfeit to knowledge. Orwell laid bare the disease, and Skinner asserted the antidote."|Chap 17, Para 69|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1587|17|70|The totalitarian power elaborated in *1984* is something wholly unprecedented, concocted in the twentieth century from the collision of industrialism and despair, a form utterly new to the human story. Orwell did more than simply fictionalize and extrapolate the totalitarian project. He sounded an alert by drawing a terrifying line of consequence from the recent German past and persistent Soviet present to an imagined but all-too-possible future. His genius was to craft a story that embodied totalitarianism's essence: the ruthless insistence upon the absolute possession of each individual human being, not as a distant other known only by its behavior, but rather from the inside out.|Chap 17, Para 70|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1588|17|71|"Big Brother's vigilance is not restricted to the grand continents of armies and statecraft or the observable flows of bodies and crowds. Big Brother is a panvasive consciousness that infects and possesses each individual soul, displacing all attachments once formed in romantic love and good fellowship. The essence of its operation is not simply that it knows every thought and feeling but rather the ruthless tenacity with which it aims to annihilate and replace unacceptable inward experience. ""We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission,"" the cunning henchman O'Brien tells the rebellious Winston:"|Chap 17, Para 71|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1589|17|72|:::  We shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back.... When finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long []as he resists us we never destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him.... We bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of ourselves before we kill him. :::|Chap 17, Para 72|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1590|17|73|"Ultimately, as every reader knows, Winston's stubborn soul is successfully ""engineered."" Orwell's chilling final passages fulfill the life of that dry seed planted at the turn of the century in Italy's impoverished soil and nourished by war, deprivation, and humiliation to flower in the nightmare of Nazi Germany and the apocalypse of Stalin's Russia, finally to bear fruit in Orwell's imagination: a testament for all time to what Mussolini had called the ""ferocious totalitarian will"" and the souls on which it feeds. Winston basks in serene elation, ""his soul white as snow.... He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother."""|Chap 17, Para 73|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1591|17|74|"In contrast, *Walden Two* was not intended as a warning but rather as the antidote to totalitarianism and, more broadly, a practical recipe for the challenges of rebuilding Western societies after the war. Skinner understood his utopia as a methodological cure for the nightmare of crushed souls, a cure that, he insisted, was superior to any of the conventional political, economic, or spiritual remedies on offer. He scoffed at the notion that ""democracy"" held the solution because it is a political system that merely perpetrates the illusion of freedom while impeding the dominion of science. The promise of the ""free market"" as the curative for postwar society was an equally empty dream, he believed, because it rewards destructive competitiveness between people and classes. Skinner also rejected existentialism's new humanism, seeing it as a breeding ground for passivity, and he regarded religion as the worst cure of all, enshrining ignorance and crippling the advance of science."|Chap 17, Para 74|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1592|17|75|"Skinner's cure was different and unique: a utopia of technique that promised a future of social equality and dispassionate harmony founded on the viewpoint of the Other-One, the ""organism among organisms,"" as the object of ""behavioral engineering."" It is the future of Meyer's dreams, in which Frazier, the founder-leader of the fictional Walden Two and Skinner's outspoken avatar, describes that ideal community as a ""superorganism"" that can be shaped and controlled ""as smoothly and efficiently as champion football teams."""|Chap 17, Para 75|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1593|17|76|"[]Skinner's utopia was meant to illustrate the possibility of a successful social order that transcends the use of force and rejects the need to dominate human souls. The Walden Two community equally disdains the practices of democratic politics and representative government. Its laws are derived from a science of human behavior, specifically Skinner's own radical behaviorism, founded on the physicist's ideal of the Other-One. His utopia was a vehicle for other ambitions as well, intended to illustrate the behavioral solutions that are essential for improvement in every domain of modern life: the nuclear threat, pollution, population control, urban growth, economic equality, crime, education, health care, the development of the individual, effective leisure. It aimed to cultivate ""the good life,"" for which all the ideals of a liberal society---freedom, autonomy, privacy, a people's right to self-rule---must be forfeit."|Chap 17, Para 76|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1594|17|77|"*Walden Two*'s fictional format provided the cover that Skinner needed to extrapolate from Meyer's methodological principles of otherness and his own research on animal behavior to a utopian community in which behavior has replaced the human spirit as the locus of control. Frazier laments that people ""have been kept in their places,"" not just by external forces, ""but much more subtly by a system of beliefs implanted within their skins. It's sometimes an almost hopeless task to take the shackles off their souls, but it can be done.... You can't in the long run enforce anything. We don't use force! All we need is adequate behavioral engineering."""|Chap 17, Para 77|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1595|17|78|These two utopias reflect two distinct species of power, and each novel was intent on rescuing the future from the twentieth-century nightmare of the soul. Orwell was able to draw on the recent past, but Skinner imagined a future that he would not live long enough to enjoy. If surveillance capitalism and its instrumentarian power continue to flourish, then it is we who may see the *Walden Two* vision realized, as freedom falls to others' knowledge---but now in the service of others' wealth and power.|Chap 17, Para 78|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1596|17|79|"Skinner's vision is brought to life in the relentless pursuit of surveillance capitalism's economic imperatives and the ubiquitous digital apparatus that surveillance capitalism creates and harnesses to its novel aims. Instrumentarian power bends the new digital apparatus---continuous, autonomous, omnipresent, sensate, computational, actuating, networked, internet-enabled---to the interests of the surveillance capitalist project, finally fulfilling Skinner's []call for the ""instruments and methods"" of ""a behavioral technology comparable in power and precision to physical and biological technology."" The result is a panvasive means of behavioral modification whose economies of action are designed to maximize surveillance revenues."|Chap 17, Para 79|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1597|17|80|Until the rise of surveillance capitalism, the prospect of instrumentarian power was relegated to a gauzy world of dream and delusion. This new species of power follows the logic of Planck, Meyer, and Skinner in the forfeit of freedom for knowledge, but those scientists each failed to anticipate the actual terms of this surrender. The knowledge that now displaces our freedom is proprietary. The knowledge is *theirs,* but the lost freedom belongs solely to *us.*|Chap 17, Para 80|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
1598|17|81|With this origin story in hand, [Chapter 13](chapter018.xhtml) turns to a close examination of instrumentarian power as it inscribes a sharp new asymmetry on the human community: the knowledge to which we sacrifice our freedom is constructed to advance surveillance capitalists' commercial interests, not our own. This is a stark departure from the technical origins of the apparatus in MacKay's principles of telemetry, which traded animals' freedom for the sake of scientific knowledge intended to benefit the animals themselves. Instead, surveillance capitalism's behavioral market regime finally has at its disposal the instruments and methods that can impose Skinner's technology of behavior across the varied domains of everyday life right down to our depths, now conceived as capital's global laboratory. ::: :::  [][CHAPTER THIRTEEN](toc.xhtml#toc-chapter018) |Chap 17, Para 81|17 A COUP FROM ABOVE
