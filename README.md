Corpus data files are `CSV` files in a specific format &mdash; __machine learning corpus format__. Files in this format are essentially files with three columns: (1) a document identity, called `doc_key`, (2) a document label, called `doc_label`, and (3) the document content, called `doc_content`. Each row contains a complete "document," defined as an analytically useful unit of discourse, such as a paragraph or chapter. 

Corpus data may be downloaded from the following shared Dropbox link:

* [TAPI Corpora Directory](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/t6im8ni921gxinr/AADL_-VPetjmDIMO3vYAFvNRa?dl=0)  

Additionally, these files may be downloaded individually:
